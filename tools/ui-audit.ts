// Markup belongs to the kit.
//
// A module says which rows, which columns, which labels. What a card or a table
// looks like is one decision, and a decision made in forty screens is forty
// answers — which is how the `data-ui` contract drifted four times in one
// afternoon before `@ketvietlab/ketsuite/ui` existed.
//
// So: no tag inside a trusted `html` template outside `packages/ketsuite/src/ui`.
// KTL fills are deliberately not included: they are the restricted extension
// language, not backend screen markup, even when their source happens to be a TS
// string. This is the same
// kind of check as tools/zero-dep-audit.ts — a rule the shape of the repo enforces
// rather than a rule people are asked to remember.
