/**
 * A process read left to right: the stages of a thing, and how many are sitting
 * in each one.
 *
 * Not a `Progress`, which answers "how far along is this one record". This
 * answers "where is the work piling up", so every stage carries its own count
 * and none of them is a percentage of the others — a stage can hold more than
 * the one before it, and a bar that normalised them would say the opposite.
 *
 * An ordered list, because the order is the meaning. The connecting rail and the
 * arrows between stages are drawn by the stylesheet from `pipeline-step-node`
 * and `pipeline-arrow`; both are decoration for an order the markup already
 * states, which is why the arrow carries no text to announce.
