# Changelog

## Unreleased — Product list and agent skill

- Add opt-in `KetTableColumn.wrap` for readable descriptive columns in server and island tables, with token-owned minimum widths and content-driven row height.
- Normalize column labels and keep a single outside table border in flat/grouped results. Operational ListPage owns the toolbar-to-result gap and renders its result count without a second surface, on desktop and mobile.
- Use the wrapping contract in the actual KetSuite Product list; align legacy list view controls with the shared responsive control height.
- Consolidate repository design guidance into the independently packaged Két Design System agent skill; API documentation and engineering rules remain in place.

## Unreleased — normalized primitives

- Standardize Text roles, shared Lucide Icon, inline Link, independent action tone/variant and stable loading geometry.
- Consolidate Field/FieldFrame label/help/error ownership; add supported scalar props, affixes, native search clear, textarea rows/resize, money currency/precision, and checked/value separation with mixed choice state.
- Extend token-based responsive layouts, badge progress/icons, native removable tag commands, avatar image fallback, shared loading indicators, progress sizes and accessible tooltip triggers/Escape.
- Preserve Két colours, Lucide, 32/36px default controls, native navigation, side labels, and compatibility aliases. CountBadge announcements now require `announce`; Notice supports an explicit announcement policy.
- Expand `/primitives` and the normalization matrix in README, hook inventory, rendering contracts and browser interaction/geometry checks.

## Unreleased — shared visual rhythm

- Pin typography, spacing, button and input dimensions to Polaris React 13.9.5 / tokens 9.4.2. Default actions use large (32px desktop / 36px mobile) to align with inputs; compact is 28/32px. Preserve Két colours, weights, Lucide and field layout.
- Apply Polaris grouping and spacing principles through Két roles: common page gutters, surface/table/modal insets, and heading gaps; retain Két colours and Lucide.
- Keep desktop table rows at 40px across density presets, with 6px cell padding; mobile retains larger rows.
- Remove grouped-presentation and page-body overrides of composed layout spacing.
- Migration: grouped pages now use the same spacing as default pages. Use public Stack gap variants for deliberate grouping; remove local spacing compensations. To roll back, revert this rhythm change as a unit, not individual module overrides.
- Catalogue: `/layering` documents the rhythm; browser checks measure both presentations.

## Unreleased

- Enhance DatePicker and DateRangePicker with accessible draft calendars, seven Vietnamese quick ranges, civil-date arithmetic, keyboard navigation and responsive month layouts. DatePicker retains native validation/fallback; DateRangePicker uses one visible range field with a preset select inside its calendar and two ISO form values. Both calendars fill mobile screens; ranges scroll vertically through multiple months. Add the `/dates` playground.

- Add `/primitives`, a render-pure harness covering every primitive with theme, density, state and content-pressure comparisons.
- Keep notice icons beside wrapping copy and place actions below it in narrow containers. Preserve icon, spinner, tag-removal and progress-value geometry with long content.
- Align checkbox/radio controls with field edges and vertical option-group labels with their first option.
- Give Select a consistent chevron inset and room for long values while retaining its native picker, keyboard and validation semantics.

- Keep explicit Stack gap variants authoritative when legacy KetSuite controls CSS is loaded.

- Backport the integration page-title contract (f6c5f413): shared 24px title token, 17px below tablet width, remove the compact operational list exception so every page uses the same title scale.

- Keep modal titles at the xl type step and section/nested surface headings at lg so headings remain distinct from body content.

- Badge and Tag now use the full pill radius, matching CountBadge across all themes and tones.

## 0.1.14 — KetSuite application navigation

- Migrated the KetSuite administration shell to the public `AppNavigation` contract.
- Kept dense desktop navigation scrollable with a pinned account footer and exposed the same hierarchy through a left-side mobile drawer.
- Preserved menu search, nested branches, one expanded top-level group, breadcrumbs, localization, and active state on leaf destinations only.
- Added a stable navigation slot so progressive fragment responses can refresh menu content without replacing the long-lived application shell.

Released as part of the coordinated KetJS 0.1.14 package set.

## 0.1.13 — application navigation

- Added the responsive `AppNavigation` shell for dense desktop sidebars and mobile drawers.
- Added nested navigation branches with a single expanded top-level group and active state on leaf items.
- Kept application breadcrumbs visible while navigation context changes.
- Added a complete application demo and browser coverage for desktop, mobile, theme switching, and nested standalone navigation.

Released as part of the coordinated KetJS 0.1.13 package set.

## 0.1.12 — reproducible inventory release

- Excluded ignored local build products from generated inventory inputs while preserving non-ignored new source files.
- Kept source-archive generation deterministic when Git metadata is unavailable.

This patch has no public component API changes and supersedes the unpublished npm attempts for 0.1.10 and 0.1.11.

## 0.1.11 — component system Waves 0–6

- Standardized the public primary scale around Indigo `#5968DF`.
- Aligned accent, focus, navigation, and informational semantic roles with the new scale in both light and dark themes.
- Updated the component catalogue specimen and added regression coverage for every public primary swatch.

- Added a deterministic public/compatibility inventory and governance checks.
- Organized component source, CSS ownership, registry metadata, specimens, and token contracts.
- Added interaction primitives and a shared progressive-enhancement runtime.
- Added typed forms, controlled pickers, data operations, and record/workspace composition.
- Added migration and release-readiness audits; deprecated compatibility page recipes remain available.
- Added a generic KetAtlas adapter descriptor, deterministic materializer and verification lock.

Released as part of the coordinated KetJS 0.1.11 package set.
