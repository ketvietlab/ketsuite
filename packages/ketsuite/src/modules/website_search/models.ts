 * An index, so a search is a lookup rather than a scan.

 * revision and matches in JavaScript. That is correct and it does not scale: the
 * cost of one keystroke grows with the site, and the window that bounds it is
 * also a ceiling on what can be found.
 *
 * The index is derived data. It is never the answer to "what is public" — the
 * publication is — so a stale index degrades a search rather than publishing
 * something it should not.
