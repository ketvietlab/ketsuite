 * The arithmetic, kept apart from the database so it can be reasoned about and

 * zero after enough of them, which is how "we have -0.0000000001 in stock" happens.

 * Round to a multiple of `precision`, away from zero at the halfway point.

 * Three things here are load-bearing, and the first version got two of them wrong:
 *
 * 1. `toPrecision(12)` before rounding. Dividing by a precision like 0.1 lands on
 *    2.9999999999999996 often enough that rounding would give 2 instead of 3.
 * 2. Half-away-from-zero, spelt out. `Math.round` rounds .5 toward positive
 *    infinity, so it sends -0.5 to -0 — which made 0.9995 compare *equal* to 1
 *    instead of less than it, silently, in one direction only.
 * 3. `toPrecision(15)` after multiplying back. Three times 0.1 is
 *    0.30000000000000004, so a rounding function that skipped this step returned a
 *    value that was not a multiple of its own precision.
