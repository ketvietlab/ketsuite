// Both functions here are DB-only (no `Ctx.storage` — see sync.ts's header
// comment) and `exposure: 'internal'`, so the generic `/_ket/fn/` HTTP path
// refuses them outright (packages/ketjs/src/server/http.ts: "call it from
// the trusted route that owns its security policy"). documents.ts is that
// caller: it writes the actual bytes via `ServeContext.storageOf`, then
// reaches these through `ctx.callUnchecked`.
//
// Only these two are generic. Recording a flattened document against its own
// row stays with the owner, because effects are declared per function and a
// write to `flow.Issue` may only be declared by the module that owns it.
