// Which projects a caller may see, and the one place that decides it.
//
// Every read of project data in this module goes through `visibleProjects` or
// `readableProject`. That is not a style preference: the only insurance against
// a leak is that there is one gate rather than fifty, because the one somebody
// forgets is the one nobody notices until a person reads what they should not.
//
// The shape is `crm.caseAudience`'s, for the same reasons it has that shape:
//
//   `null` means "everything". Either the call carries no actor at all — a job
//   or a fixture running as the system — or the actor is a superuser, or the
//   actor holds a company-wide grant. A grant row is the business-manager
//   alternative to making somebody a technical superuser.
//
//   Anything else is the list of projects they are a member of, and a caller
//   who is a member of nothing reads nothing. A project with no members is
//   visible to nobody, which is the only safe default for a model whose whole
//   purpose is to keep some projects unread.
//
// That a superuser passes is a decision, not an oversight. FLW-DEC-021 asked it
// directly and the answer was yes: a superuser is the customer's own root
// account and every other KetSuite module treats it that way, so making Flow
// the one that holds it back would break the admin tooling and every fixture
// that runs as one, for nothing the grant row does not already offer.
//
// See FLW-DEC-012 and FLW-DEC-021.

/**
 * Answered once per call, not once per query.

 * A single function call cannot change who the caller is or what they are a
 * member of, and `issueQuery` alone runs several queries for one screen. Three
 * reads per query became three reads per call the moment this was added, which
 * is the difference between a filter you can afford everywhere and one you
 * start leaving out.
 *
 * Keyed weakly by the context, so it lives exactly as long as the call does and
 * a transaction's own context — `ctx.tx` hands the body a different one — gets
 * its own answer rather than inheriting a stale one.
 *
 * The consequence to know: a call that adds or removes a member does not see
 * its own change. No command does that today — each one gates first and writes
 * after — but a command that wanted to would have to ask the tables itself
 * rather than expect this to have noticed.
