  // 0.2.0 adds the backlog index; no data change, so the migration is the
  // index alone. 0.3.0 adds ProjectMember, which decides what anybody sees —
  // an empty table means an empty Flow until somebody is added to a project.
  // 0.4.0 adds ProjectDeletion and the purge job behind it: the record of a
  // deletion has to outlive the project, so it is a table rather than a flag.
  // 0.5.0 adds ProjectGuard, a row per project that exists only to be
  // contended on, so "one active sprint" survives two people pressing start.
