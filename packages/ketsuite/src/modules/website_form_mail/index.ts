/**
 * Telling an operator a form submission arrived — without putting the
 * submission in an email.
 *
 * `mail_transport` already owns the outbox: Delivery, retry, dead-letter and
 * the provider events. This module is only the bridge, so `website_form` keeps
 * no delivery state of its own and no second ledger appears.
 *
 * The notification says which form, on which site, when, and where to open it.
 * It carries nothing the visitor typed, and that is a deliberate boundary
 * rather than a default nobody chose:
 *
 *   - A Delivery stores an immutable body snapshot. Putting the payload in the
 *     mail would persist contact data a second time, in another module, in a
 *     row that cannot be edited or purged — while the submission itself is
 *     under a retention policy that promises exactly that.
 *   - `Form.notifyTo` is checked for the shape of an email address and nothing
 *     else. Anyone who may edit a form may point it anywhere. With a bare
 *     notification, doing so leaks that a form was submitted; with the payload,
 *     it is a standing export of everyone's contact details.
 *   - The consent notice a visitor agreed to does not mention an email copy,
 *     and under the versioning contract, changing it to say so would
 *     invalidate every page currently open.
 *
 * Widening this later is additive — a template may ask for more keys once
 * SAFE_KEYS grows. Narrowing it is not: mail that has been sent cannot be
 * recalled from a mailbox, a forward, or a provider's storage.
