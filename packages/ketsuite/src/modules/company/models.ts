/**
 * Legal entities.
 *
 * A company is backed by a party, as in the domain contract and SAP: the organisation you invoice
 * from is an organisation, and it turns up in documents as a counterparty when two
 * of your own companies trade. Keeping one party model rather than a second
 * organisation model is the part of the domain contract's design worth copying.
 *
 * `parentId` is a branch in the *organisational* sense — a subsidiary with its own
 * books. It is not the branch dimension on rows: that one lives in the scope
 * machinery and answers "which warehouse", not "which legal entity".
 *
 * Shared, not company-scoped, and deliberately: the list of companies has to be
 * readable to know which company a request could act as. A company-scoped list of
 * companies is a circle.
