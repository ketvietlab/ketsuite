 * The two derived figures the CRM keeps, kept current without anyone asking.
 *
 * Scoring rules and the leaderboard both existed as functions a user had to
 * invoke by hand, so a pipeline that nobody clicked through showed a score of
 * zero and an empty leaderboard. Both are now enqueued by the writes that
 * invalidate them: saving a case rescores it, and closing one restates its
 * owner's standing. Each job is keyed on the record it touches, so a burst of
 * edits collapses into one run.
