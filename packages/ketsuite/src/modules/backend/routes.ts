 * order and the first condition this viewer may call wins. A housekeeper who can
 * complete a cleaning task lands on the cleaning worklist rather than on whichever
 * screen happens to sort first.
 *
 * Falling back to the first path in menu order is what every deployment does
 * today, and it stays the answer for anyone no entry matches — but it is a
 * fallback, not a decision. The entry with the smallest `sequence` is an accident
 * of declaration order.
