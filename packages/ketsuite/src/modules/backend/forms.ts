 * What a route holds after a submit it turned down.

 * three out by hand: the dialog stays open, what was typed comes back, and each
 * complaint lands on the control that caused it. The usual `errors.length` test
 * gets the first one wrong the moment every complaint is a field mark, because
 * then there is no form-level sentence to count.
 *
 * The words come from `backend.validation.*`. A schema names a message key for
 * each code it can raise, so the sentences belong to whoever ships the codes,
 * not to each module that adopts a schema.
