/**
 * Parties, and the three things the domain contract folds into them.
 *
 * `res.partner` is one table for customer, supplier, contact, delivery address,
 * invoice address, legal entity and bank account owner. It works, and the cost is
 * visible in the model itself: `is_company` to ask whether this is a legal entity,
 * `type` to ask whether it is an address, and a computed computed commercial-party pointer
 * to answer the only question invoicing actually cares about — who do we bill.
 *
 * That third one is the tell. It exists *because* addresses are parties: when a
 * delivery address is itself a partner, the system has lost the ability to say who
 * the counterparty is, so it walks up the parent chain to recover it.
 *
 * SAP, Tryton and ERPNext all keep addresses separate, and SAP keeps roles as rows.
 * Doing the same here removes computed commercial-party pointer and `type` outright: the
 * party on a document *is* the party, and an address is an address.
 *
 * What is kept from the domain contract: parties are shared across companies, one address book
 * for the tenant. That was decided when products were.
