/**
 * The sidebar's project group, filled into `backend:nav.items`.
 *
 * Flow's screens are scoped to a project, and `MenuDef.path` is a fixed
 * string — "the board of the project I am looking at" is not a path the menu
 * tree can hold. The joint exists for exactly that: the shell hands over the
 * active path, and a module that can read a record out of it contributes the
 * rows the tree could not.
 *
 * An island is handed props and nothing else — no context, no translator — so
 * the wording lives here, keyed by the `lang` the shell passes, the same way
 * mail_backend's inbox indicator handles the one other shell joint anyone
 * fills. The group is labelled with a word rather than the project's name:
 * the name needs a query, the island cannot make one, and the screen it
 * belongs to already carries it as a heading.
