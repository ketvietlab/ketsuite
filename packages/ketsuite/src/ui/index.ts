// The KetSuite component kit.
//
// A module composes these and never writes a tag or a `data-ui` attribute itself —
// `tools/ui-audit.ts` enforces exactly that. The point is not that markup is ugly
// in TypeScript; it is that markup spread across forty screens has no single place
// to change, and the stylesheet's contract drifts one screen at a time.
//
// Every component is a plain `(props) => TemplateResult`. No runtime, no lifecycle,
// no client state: the backend renders on the server and keeps what it knows in the
// URL (D43). Interactivity, where a screen genuinely needs it, is an island.
//
// The public foundation lives in @ketvietlab/design-system. The backend module
// loads its CSS first, then this compatibility kit while screens migrate to the
// public components. New shared UI must enter through that public contract.

/**
 * The same components, under the names JSX wants.
 *
 * `tools/ui-audit.ts` requires a screen to write `<Section />` rather than
 * `section(...)`, because a screen that calls the function can quietly grow an
 * argument the JSX form cannot express. But the kit only exported camelCase, so
 * every screen opened with the same five lines of aliasing — `framedPage as
 * Framed` in fifty-five files, `recordForm as RecordForm` in forty-nine — and the
 * rule cost more to obey than it was worth.
 *
 * These are the same functions, not wrappers: a component here takes one options
 * object, which is exactly what JSX hands it. That is also the entry rule — a
 * positional helper (`stack(items, gap)`, `emptyState(message, hint)`,
 * `dataTable(_, table)`) has no PascalCase name, because JSX would hand it a props
 * object where it wants a list. `backend-ui.test.ts` checks the arity.
