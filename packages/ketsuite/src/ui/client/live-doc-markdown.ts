// Markdown in, blocks out.
//
// The editor's vocabulary and Markdown's overlap almost exactly, which is the
// whole reason this is worth having: people already write `## ` and `**bold**`
// out of habit, and they paste from README files, chat and issue trackers that
// speak it. What arrives on the clipboard is the source, and the source is
// what somebody meant.
//
// A deliberately small subset — the blocks the editor has and the marks it can
// carry, and nothing else. There is no table, no image, no footnote, no
// reference link, because there is nowhere to put them: a parser that produced
// a node the renderer cannot draw would lose it silently, which is worse than
// leaving the characters alone. Anything unrecognised stays literal text.
//
// Pure and DOM-free on purpose, so it can be tested without a browser — which
// is most of why the paste path is worth trusting.

/**
 * Emphasis, innermost text first.
 *
 * No inner text may contain its own delimiter, and it may not begin or end
 * with a space: the second half stops `2 * 3 * 4` turning half a sum italic,
 * and the first stops the italic rule opening on the first `*` of a bold pair
 * and eating the second as content. Inline code does not recurse — what is
 * inside it is characters.
 *
 * `word` marks the two rules that may not open or close inside a word, which
 * is CommonMark's own asymmetry between `_` and `*` and exists for exactly one
 * reason: `snake_case_name` is a name, not a sentence with a slant in it.
