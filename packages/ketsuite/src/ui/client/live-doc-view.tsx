// The collaborative editor's DOM<->Yjs binding.
//
// The first version of this file was one flat rich-text run with bold and
// italic — deliberately narrow, to prove the CRDT binding and IME handling
// before spending anything on vocabulary. This is that vocabulary: paragraphs,
// three heading levels, quote, code block, bullet/numbered/checklist items,
// and the marks bold/italic/strikethrough/code/link.
//
// The document is a flat list of blocks, not a tree. Each block is a
// `Y.XmlElement('block')` carrying a `type` attribute and one `Y.XmlText`
// child; nesting exists only in the rendered HTML, where consecutive list
// items share a `<ul>`. A tree would buy indented sub-lists and cost a
// position model that no longer maps to `(blockIndex, offset)` — the pair
// every operation below is written in terms of. Sub-lists are the thing given
// up for that, stated rather than pretended away.
//
// Runtime-agnostic on purpose: `html` comes from the caller so the same code
// renders server-side (flow_backend/islands.ts, importing @ketvietlab/ketjs-view
// directly) and client-side (editor-client.mjs, importing the framework's
// browser-served /_ket/view/index.js) — the same split mail_backend's own
// chatter view uses.
