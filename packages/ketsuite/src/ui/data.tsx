 * A hierarchy of documents, nested the way it reads.

 * a `<ol>` inside its parent `<li>` is what says "these belong under that one"
 * to a screen reader, to a keyboard, and to anything that reformats the page.
 * A padded string only says it to someone looking at it.
 *
 * Rows arrive flat — the query builder has no recursive read — and are grouped
 * here by their parent. Every row is drawn exactly once, wherever it ends up:
 * one whose parent is not in the list (archived, or filtered away by a search)
 * is shown at the root, and so is one caught in a parent cycle. Both used to
 * be handled by the same test — "is the parent present?" — which covers the
 * first and not the second: two rows pointing at each other are both present,
 * so neither reached the root and both vanished from the screen entirely.
 * Stored data should never be shaped that way, but a view that silently drops
 * records is the wrong way to find out that it is.
