// `flow_backend.menu.sprints` was asked for by the sprints screen and defined
// nowhere, so the subtitle rendered as the raw key — in both languages, on a
// screen anybody could open. A translator that answers with the key it was given
// is the one output a person cannot read as deliberate, and nothing in the
// suite's audits looks for it: `audit:terminology` reads the words that exist,
// not the words that were asked for and are missing.
