// The five things project membership has to be true about, proven end to end.
//
// FLW-DEC-012 made Flow's projects private to their members. That is one rule
// with a large blast radius: it is enforced in one module, `membership.ts`, and
// every read of project data in Flow is supposed to pass through it. This file
// is what stops "supposed to" from being the whole guarantee.
//
// Two of the tests are about behaviour and three are about the shape of the
// code, because behaviour tests alone cannot prove a negative — that no read
// path skipped the gate. The static test at the bottom does that part.
