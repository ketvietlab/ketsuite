# CRM

KetSuite CRM is an open-source sales application for leads and opportunities. One record type — the
case — moves through a stage pipeline, carries its own conversation and activities, and turns into a
quotation when it is won.

## Modules

- `crm`: cases, lead conversion, stages, teams, assignment, scoring, tags, activities and timeline.
- `crm_staff_channel`: audience-scoped pipeline reads and explicit transition, assignment, and mark-won
  commands for the Staff Channel API.
- `crm_sale`: quotations written from an opportunity, and the products they may be written for.
- `crm_backend`: pipeline board, record workspace, planner, leaderboard and configuration. Auto-installs
  once `backend` is present.
- `crm_website`: the public lead-capture form.

`crm` depends on `company`, `partner`, `user`, `mail`, `activity` and `calendar`. A headless
deployment gets the domain and its functions with no admin UI.

## The case

A `Case` is a lead or an opportunity — the same row, distinguished by `kind`, so converting one keeps
its history, its conversation and its id. Money, probability and the lost reason live in a
`SalesDetail` beside it, which is what lets a lead exist before anyone has put a number on it.

```

`terminalState` lives on the stage, not on the case: moving a case into a stage marked `won` closes
it and stamps `closedAt`, and moving it back into an open stage clears the date again. Reporting
reads that one field for cycle time.

## Who sees which case

Every read resolves one audience and applies it the same way, whether the caller is listing, opening
a record or counting duplicates. Company isolation is enforced by the data layer before this record
policy runs:

- no actor — a job, a fixture, the seed — sees everything;
- a superuser sees everything;
- an agent sees cases assigned to them plus unassigned work in their active team queues;
- a team leader sees assigned and unassigned cases in teams they lead;
- a role holding `crm.scope.team` sees the cases of every team the user belongs to;
- a role holding `crm.scope.company` sees every case in the company.

How far somebody reaches is part of their roles, like everything else they may do, so the role
screen that grants it is also where it shows. There is no separate access table to drift from it.

Creating a record does not grant permanent access after somebody else owns it. List, group, summary,
and duplicate queries push the audience clauses into SQL, so a filter can only narrow a permitted
set. Commands resolve the appropriate action again before they write; knowing a record id does not
bypass the policy.

The Staff Channel API keeps that same audience boundary. `GET /api/staff/v1/crm/leads` provides bounded
search, kind and outcome filters with an opaque cursor; `GET /api/staff/v1/crm/leads/{id}` provides a narrow
detail and the next pending activity. Neither projection carries raw email or phone fields, internal
timeline/messages, attachments, or option lists. The detail carries CRM's real integer version, and the
transition, claim, reassign, and terminal-state routes pass it straight to the existing domain commands. Those commands also
require the bootstrap CSRF token and an `Idempotency-Key`, isolate replay state by company, actor, and command,
and return the refreshed safe projection with its new integer ETag. Create, mark-lost, and activity commands
stay unpublished until their path or request-shape mismatch can be resolved without inventing behavior.

## Assignment

A case is assigned inside its team. `crm.case.assign` is the initial assignment and queue-claim
command; it does not change an already-owned record. For system routing it takes an explicit user,
or falls through to the team's `assignmentMode`:

- `manual` — nobody is chosen automatically;
- `round_robin` — the team's cursor walks its active members in `sequence` order;
- `capacity` — the member with the most headroom against their `capacity` wins.

Both routing modes read `TeamMember`. Open **Configuration → Teams**, then open a team row to manage
its members on the team page. Capacity is a routing weight rather than a maximum record count. A team
with no members can only be assigned by hand. An ordinary agent can atomically claim only unassigned
work in one of their queues and can claim it only for themselves.

`crm.case.reassign` is the separate ownership-transfer command. It requires the current `version`, an
idempotency key, an active target team and member, and one of the documented business reasons. The
`manual_correction` reason also requires a note. A successful transfer increments the version and
writes an immutable timeline entry containing the previous and new team and assignee. Retrying the
same key replays the result; a stale version fails without changing the record.

## Scoring and the leaderboard

`ScoreRule` rows describe what a case is worth: a supported field (`email`, `utmSource`, or
`expectedRevenue`), an operator (`eq`, `contains`, `present`, `gte`), a value and a number of points.
Email and UTM source come from the case; expected revenue comes from its `SalesDetail`. Saving a case
enqueues `crm.score`, so the figure follows the record rather than waiting for someone to press a
button; `crm.case.refreshScore` recomputes on demand. The scoring write neither bumps `version` nor
overwrites a concurrent edit, so a form left open stays valid.

Closing a case enqueues `crm.gamification` for its owner, which restates one row of the leaderboard
from counting queries. **CRM → Leaderboard** also recalculates the whole table on request.

## Duplicates and merging

The record workspace lists cases that share an email, a phone or a name with the one being edited,
each with a one-click merge. Phones are matched on `phoneDigits`, a normalised copy written beside
the number a user typed, so `090 123 4567` and `0901234567` are one number. Two different dialling
forms of the same number — `+84 90…` against `090…` — are not: normalising a country prefix is a
dialling-plan question this module does not answer.

A merge archives the source, points `mergedIntoId` at the target and moves the tags, notes,
activities, meetings and timeline across. The target's own figures win; the source only fills a
blank. A record that has already been merged or archived cannot be merged again.

## Lead capture from the website

`/contact/sales` is anonymous and writes into the company the site is served under. Three things
follow from that:

- **the company must exist.** Writes are pinned to `scope.company`, and a scope naming a company that
  was never created discards them. The endpoint establishes this first and answers
  `crm_website.error.inboxUnavailable` rather than failing later on an empty stage table.
- **the visitor never names the record.** The case id is derived inside a `website-lead:` namespace,
  so a submission is idempotent without being able to address a case that already exists.
- **submissions are rate limited**, per source and per email address, in a tenant-wide table. A hidden
  field a browser leaves empty catches the least careful scripts.

Under multi-tenancy the anonymous company comes from the deployment: a tenant subdomain, the
`X-Ket-Company` header, or `sessions.anonymous` in the app declaration.

## Company scope

Case data is company scoped, and the seed rows are too. Ids are the primary key across the whole
tenant, so the first company to be seeded takes `crm-stage-new` and every company after it takes
`<company>:crm-stage-new`; `seededId` resolves whichever of the two a company actually holds. Without
that split the second company in a tenant silently received no stages at all and every case it tried
to create was refused.

## Backend screens

- **Pipeline** — a kanban board, one column per stage, under four figures counted over the same
  filter the columns are: open records, total value, weighted value and overdue activities. Filtering
  is the shared list chrome — search, team, "mine", and a switch to the same records as a list — so
  the header and the cards always agree. A column head carries its count, the share of its money the
  forecast counts, and that money; its menu creates a record in that stage or opens the stage in the
  list. A card carries the party, its tags, the amount and probability, the next activity with its due
  date in red when it is late, and the owner. Moving is drag-and-drop, with a per-card disclosure
  holding the stage select and a real POST as the no-JavaScript fallback.
- **Cases** — the shared list chrome: search, filters, grouping, saved state in the URL.
- **Record workspace** — duplicates, the record form, and the commands that were previously reachable
  only over the API: move, assign and merge. A lead converts through a confirmation dialog that
  captures the opportunity stage, expected revenue and expected closing date. An open opportunity
  closes through one dialog for either won or lost, with a required outcome note and confirmation.
  Tabs cover sales (figures and quotations), activities (open work, meetings, history) and the timeline.
- **Planner** — CRM activities only, each linked back to its case, with complete and cancel on the row.
- **Leaderboard** — standings, recalculated on request.
- **Configuration** — five lists: teams, stages, tags, assignment rules and lead/opportunity scoring.
  Clicking anywhere on a row opens it. Adding or editing a team uses a full page, with member
  management inside that page; the other four records use centered route dialogs. Each list can show
  active, archived or all records, and lifecycle changes are made inside the opened record.

URL-owned CRM overlays use centered dialogs on desktop, including the four non-team configuration
forms and the activity scheduler. On narrow screens the shared dialog contract expands them to the
full viewport; CRM does not use right-side sheets.

The board's figures come from `crm.pipeline.summary`, which takes the screen's filters and answers
per-stage counts and amounts plus the four totals. Every column keeps its own figures, including Won
and Lost, because that is what a column head states; the four above the board count only the stages
that are still open, so winning a deal does not make the pipeline total climb. Counts come from SQL and are exact; the amounts
need `crm.SalesDetail` for every matching case, so past five thousand of them the function reports
`partial` and the screen drops the two money cards rather than showing the total of a subset. A role
that predates the function still gets the board — the header simply has nothing to state.

Relational fields — partner, owner, team, stage, tags, merge source, quotation product — are pickers
that search server-side and, where it makes sense, create the missing record inline. Fields over a
small fixed vocabulary — kind, priority, warehouse, activity type, plan — stay native selects.

Every mutating admin route refuses a cross-origin POST.

## Partner to closed opportunity

The Partner record contributes **Create lead** when `crm_backend` is installed. That action opens the
dedicated lead form with the Partner, contact name, email and phone prefilled, and cancel returns to the
same Partner. This path requires both the Partner and a stated need; a Partner does not become a lead
merely because it was imported or created.

Conversion updates the existing case from `lead` to `opportunity`. It keeps the case id, Partner,
owner, conversation and timeline, while storing the expected revenue and closing date in its existing
`SalesDetail`. Closing also updates that same record. The required outcome note is retained on the
terminal timeline event; a lost result additionally becomes the sales detail's lost reason.

## Building on the case

`crm.Case` is a shared header, and a module that depends on the CRM may store its own `kind` on it —
a support ticket, a warranty claim, whatever that module is for. The CRM's own screens are scoped to
the kinds it owns: a foreign kind does not appear in the case list, its count, its grouping or the
duplicate finder, and `case.get` answers `null` for it so the record workspace does not claim a row
whose `case.save` would refuse it.

The owning module answers for those rows through its own functions and screens. `crmOwnedKinds()` and
`crmOwnsKind()` are exported so an extension can align with the same boundary, alongside the helpers
it needs to write one: `crmSaveCase`, `crmCaseAudience`, `crmCanReadCase`, `crmVisibleCases`,
`crmSerializeCaseList`, `crmSeededId` and `crmAddTimeline`.

`receiveAttachment` is exported for the same reason: an extension whose records carry photographs
should not reimplement streaming, upload limits, checksums and object keys — that is what `storage`
is for.

## Scope boundary

The OSS modules do not contain support tickets, SLA, complaints, knowledge base, canned responses,
post-sale fulfillment, Customer Care follow-up, outcome tracking, customer support portal or reseller
care. Deployments can provide those capabilities from a private extension without changing the public
lead/opportunity domain.

The public extension surface includes CRM domain helpers, Sale function specs for transactional
composition, and backend form/attachment/modal primitives. These are neutral extension contracts and
contain no Customer Care behavior.

## Verification

```bash
# Run from: /path/to/ketjs
npm run build
node --test .build/test/crm-e2e.test.js .build/test/crm-ux.test.js .build/test/crm-i18n.test.js
npm run bench:crm
KET_BENCH_DRIVER=postgres KET_BENCH_PG='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/postgres' npm run bench:crm
```

For a browser pass over the screens, seed a throwaway database and serve it:

```bash
# Run from: /path/to/ketjs
KET_VISUAL_SQLITE=/tmp/crm-visual.db npm run visual:crm:seed
```

The seed prints the sign-in it created. Point the server at that file and open `/admin/crm/pipeline`.

## Sales dashboard data contract

`crm.report.sales({ start, end, timezone? })` is the public, live sales projection. It uses the
caller's company and record visibility before loading related rows. `start` is inclusive, `end`
exclusive; both are datetime instants. The timezone (UTC by default) controls day deadlines and
monthly buckets. The end is capped at the current time. Periods must start before now, be ordered,
and span at most 3,660 days. Metadata includes the company currency and observation time.

The existing `crm.overview` and `crm.pipeline.summary` remain compatible. Consumers can adopt the
new report independently; this change does not replace a downstream dashboard or snapshot pipeline.

| Output | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `period.newLeads` | Cases acquired as leads in the selected period, including leads subsequently converted in place. |
| `period.won`, `lost`, `winRate` | Latest case outcome with `closedAt` in the period. Win rate is won / (won + lost); no outcomes returns null. |
| `period.medianSalesCycleDays` | Median elapsed time from case creation to close for won cases. |
| `comparison.period` | The same flow metrics for the immediately preceding window of equal elapsed duration. |
| `cohort` | Lead-origin cases created in the selected period, followed through the observation time. Direct opportunities are excluded. Contacted, converted and won are parallel cohort milestones; contact is not a required conversion step. |
| `cohort.contactedWithin24h` | Explicit `reached` customer interaction within 24 elapsed hours of creation. |
| `cohort.convertedWithin14d` | Conversion to opportunity within 14 elapsed days. This is not an independent qualification assessment. |
| `pipeline` | Current active open opportunities, exact decimal expected/weighted revenue and per-stage totals. |
| `teams` | Current owner/team for open pipeline; owner/team captured at closing for outcomes. Includes unassigned and unknown-history buckets. |
| `health`, `risks` | Open opportunities with no pending activity, an overdue pending activity, or no recorded successful contact for over 14 days. Risk reasons overlap; `atRiskCount` counts each case once. |
| `lostReasons` | Standard categories, plus `not_recorded` for legacy free text or an uncategorized transition. |
| `trend` | Monthly won/lost counts and win rate within the selected period, including empty months. |
| `coverage` | Unknown acquisition kind, missing closing ownership, uncategorized losses and leads without recorded successful contact. |

Window metrics expose `eligible`, `pending`, `successes` and `rate`. Only cases old enough to complete
the entire observation window enter the rate denominator, even if a younger case has already
succeeded. An empty mature cohort returns null, not zero. All cohort follow-up is observed at `asOf`,
including events after the acquisition period ends. Historical reports are live restatements of the
latest case outcomes, not immutable snapshots: reopening a case removes its previous outcome from
these aggregates. A change from won to lost gets a new close timestamp; editing the same outcome
retains its timestamp. Archived closed records still count; merged source records do not.

### Recording the missing evidence

- New cases keep immutable `originKind`. Conversion sets missing legacy origin to `lead`. Reporting
  also recognizes a legacy current lead, `convertedAt`, or conversion timeline event without rewriting
  history. An old direct opportunity without evidence stays unknown.
- Every close path (save, stage move, explicit won/lost, conversion to a terminal stage) captures
  `closedAssigneeUserId`, `closedTeamId` and `closedOwnershipRecordedAt`. Later reassignment does not
  change attribution. Reopening clears the snapshot. An old closed case is not backfilled with its
  current owner; a recorded unassigned close is distinguished from missing history.
- `crm.case.markLost` accepts optional `lostReasonCode`: `budget`, `fit`, `competitor`, `no_need`,
  `other`. Existing callers can still send free-text `lostReason`. The modal provides category and
  note; moving/reopening into a different outcome clears stale categories. Version conflict refusals
  cannot overwrite the reason.
- `crm.case.logInteraction` accepts `id`, `expectedVersion`, `channel`, `outcome`, optional
  `occurredAt`/`note`, and `idempotencyKey`. Channels are phone, email, chat, meeting and other;
  outcomes are attempted, reached and unreachable. The event records actor, occurrence time and
  entry time. Backdated entries must fall between case creation and now. Matching retries replay
  the result; key reuse with different input is refused. The case modal exposes a draft-preserving
  nested “Log interaction” dialog and renders channel/outcome in its timeline.

Activity completion, reassignment, internal notes and generic `updatedAt` changes are not evidence of
customer contact. Contact metrics mean **recorded** contact: an absent historical event cannot prove
that no conversation occurred. Consumers must show the coverage caveat for historical cohorts.
The stale-contact signal likewise means no recorded successful contact, using creation as the
baseline when there is no contact history.

Activity deadlines remain calendar dates. Overdue is measured in local calendar days; hour-level
labels such as “overdue 2h” are unsupported. Current pipeline must not be presented as a historical
snapshot. Delivered net revenue, refunds, repeat purchasing and private snapshot orchestration belong
to downstream integrations and are not included in this public sales report.
