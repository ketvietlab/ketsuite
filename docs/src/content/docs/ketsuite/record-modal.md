title: Record modals
description: The KetSuite contract for opening a collection's records in a client-side modal island.
---

The design system settles *what* happens when a reader opens a row: the record opens in a
`ModalSheet` over its collection, never on a separate page, and the modal is a client-side island
(see "Collections open records in a modal" in `@ketvietlab/design-system`). This page is *how* every
KetSuite module does it, so a care task, a sales case and a partner behave identically.

A record that is a workspace of its own opens on its page instead (see [Record pages](#record-pages)):
the same definition, rendered by the same client runtime in its page presentation.
Administration profiles — a user, a role, an access policy — are the exception: they open on their own
page on the same runtime with route-provided context. See [Administration profiles](#record-pages-for-administration-profiles) below.

## URL

One shape for every module:

```
# File: URL shape of every KetSuite record modal
/admin/<collection>?<list state>&record=<kind>:<id>&tab=<tab>
```

- `kind` is `<module>.<name>` (for example `customer_care.followup`) and never contains a colon; the
  id may.
- Build links with `recordModalHref(url, { kind, id, tab })`. It keeps the collection's own query, so
  filters, sort and page survive opening and closing.
- `record` and `tab` are reserved for the record modal. A collection that has its own tabs (for example
  configuration sections) names them with another parameter, such as `section`; otherwise opening or
  closing a record would overwrite the collection's tab.
- The server always renders the collection with a **closed** host. A deep link opens the record after
  hydration; server and first client render stay identical.

## Server side

1. Rows and cards link with `recordModalHref`; create actions with `recordModalCreateHref`.
2. The module declares one island per record kind with `defineRecordModalIsland({ kind, client, export })`
   and places it through `backend:runtime`. Its props are empty.
3. The module exposes one permission-checked read, `<module>.<kind>.modalContext({ id })`, returning
   `{ data, messages }`. `data` is everything the views need in one round trip, including the viewer's
   `permissions`; `messages` are the translated strings the views and the runtime use, including the
   `recordModal.*` labels below.
4. Writes are the module's existing domain functions. The modal adds no form routes; the server stays
   authoritative for permissions and validation.

## Client side

`createRecordModal(definition)` returns the island factory the module exports.

```tsx
// File: modules/customer_care/assets/followup-modal-view.tsx
export const followupModal = createRecordModal<FollowupContext>({
  kind: 'customer_care.followup',
  size: 'large',
  context: { fn: 'customer_care.followup.modalContext' },
  title: (c) => c.data.task.title,
  header: (c) => <CustomerStrip context={c} />,
  tabs: [
    { id: 'call', label: (c) => c.t('customer_care.modal.call'), view: CallTab },
    { id: 'result', label: (c) => c.t('customer_care.modal.result'), visible: (c) => c.data.permissions.work, view: ResultTab },
  ],
  dialogs: { reassign: { title: (c) => c.t('customer_care.action.reassign'), view: ReassignDialog } },
  commands: {
    complete: { fn: 'customer_care.followup.complete', input: completeInput, after: 'close' },
    claim: { fn: 'customer_care.followup.claim', input: versioned, after: 'reload' },
  },
})
```

The runtime owns, for every module:

| Concern | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Opening | A click on a link naming this kind opens it (`pushState`); a link to the open record switches tab (`replaceState`). `record=<kind>:new` opens the create form (see below). |
| History | Back and forward over modal entries open or close the modal only. The navigation layer asks through the cancelable `ket:popstate` event and does not re-fetch the page. |
| Accessibility | `ModalSheet mode="client"`: close controls are buttons, focus moves in and is trapped, Escape closes the top layer, the rest of the page is inert, focus returns to the opener. |
| Height | A definition with more than one tab renders `ModalSheet height="fixed"`, and the runtime owns that height: it measures each tab it renders and holds the tallest as a min-height, so the dialog opens at the size of its content and never shrinks as the reader moves between tabs — and a record whose tabs are all short never gets a dialog the height of the screen. The floor belongs to the record and starts again with the next one. `TabbedView` keeps the bar fixed and only its `TabPanel` scrolls; the panel adds no horizontal padding. A single view and dialog layers size to their content. |
| States | Loading, load failure with retry, not found. |
| Cache | Each island keeps the last 30 contexts it read (including the create form's). Reopening one renders it at once and reads it again quietly behind it. A successful command drops the record it changed, and `ket:records-changed` for the kind drops the named ids (all when none are named). A definition sets `cache: false` when its context must never be shown before a fresh read. |
| Commands | A form inside the modal names its command with a `__command` field (or a submit button with `name="__command"`). The runtime maps `FormData` through `command.input`, calls `/_ket/fn` with an idempotency key, and applies `after`: `close`, `reload`, `refresh`, `stay`, `{ tab }` or `{ dialog }`. |
| Previews | A command marked `preview: true` asks what would happen instead of making it happen. Its function writes nothing, so the record is not re-read, the collection is not told and what was typed stays on screen. The answer reaches the view as `context.outcome<T>('<command>')`, beside the form that asked for it, and is cleared as soon as anything moves — another record, tab or dialog, a refusal, or the write itself. This is how a change with consequences is confirmed: one form, two submit buttons, and the commit offered only once the consequence has been read. |
| Answers | `context.outcome` also carries what a command with `after: 'stay'` returned, which is how something the server can say only once — a one-time credential — reaches the reader. Every other `after` replaces the layer, and the answer goes with it. |
| Refusals | Issues with a `field` are read back by the view through `context.fieldError(name)`; the rest render as a danger notice at the top of the layer. A code that neither `messages` nor `labels` translate reads as `recordModal.saveFailed`, never as the code itself. Text/select values survive through `context.draft(name, fallback)` and checkbox/radio state through `context.draftChecked(name, value, fallback)`. A child workflow can explicitly seed a field from the captured parent with `context.recordDraft?.(name, fallback)`; child drafts remain isolated until its command succeeds. If that command consumes parent fields, declare `clearRecordDrafts: [name]` on the command; only those drafts clear after successful completion, while refusal/cancel preserves them. |
| Success | A command that leaves the modal open says so where a refusal would have appeared: a positive notice at the top of the layer (`recordModal.savedTitle` / `recordModal.saved`). It clears on the next submit and when another record opens. A command that closes the modal says it by closing. |
| Unsaved input | Switching tabs preserves text, select, checkbox and radio drafts without prompting. Closing asks `recordModal.unsaved` only for the top layer being discarded. |
| Dialogs | An element with `data-record-dialog="<name>"` opens a dialog layer of the same record; `data-record-param-*` attributes become its params. Closing it returns to the record without reloading. |
| Uploads | A command's `upload` names file fields; each file is stored through `/files` with the metadata the command gives, and the attachment ids reach `input` as its third argument. A `data-record-submit` file input submits on choice, and a `data-record-dropzone` form takes a dropped file. |
| View state | `context.state(key)` reads what a `data-record-state` control set: a button or link with `data-record-value` on click, an input or select on change. It resets when another record opens. |
| Islands | `recordIsland(name, props)` places an island inside a view; the runtime asks the page's island manager to start it (`ket:islands-attach`) and to dispose it when its host leaves (`ket:islands-detach`). A joint filled with islands renders in a record modal this way. |
| Collection | After a successful command the runtime dispatches `ket:records-changed`; the backend shell re-fetches the content slot as a fragment. The modal lives outside that slot and is untouched. |

Views are render-pure. They read the context and return design-system markup (`RecordForm`, `Field`,
`DataTable`, `Notice`…); they never fetch, never touch history and never query the document. The runtime
builds `TabbedView` and `TabPanel`; a module supplies the tab's label and view and must not create its own
tab-body wrapper, padding, or scrolling contract.

`RecordModalForm` accepts a `body` after its standard fields for composed controls such as an ordered
value editor. Pass `dirty` when a structural edit changes the draft without leaving a changed visible
input. The runtime combines that flag with native field checks when deciding whether closing needs a
discard confirmation. A public `ReorderList` emits its ordered IDs through a native hidden input change;
the record runtime captures all current fields before applying that view state.

A command may supply `issueField(path, submittedForm, context)` to map server validation paths to stable
native control names. Ordered editors map indexed paths using the submitted order snapshot, so an error
stays with its row if the reader later changes the order. Matched native names display inline once;
unmatched and general failures remain in the layer notice.

## Tabs other modules add

A module that owns a record cannot know the tabs a module composed later wants on it. Such a record takes
`extensionTabs(context)` beside its declared `tabs`: they follow the declared ones, pass the same `visible`
filter and render through the same `TabbedView`. A definition that takes extension tabs keeps the fixed
height, because it may gain a tab at any time.

The record's context function supplies them from a joint. A client modal cannot render a joint, so only island
fills cross: the context lists each fill's island, and the view places it with `recordIsland`. The product
template modal reads `product_backend:template.recordTabs` — a module fills it with one island placement, the
island renders the panel with `{ templateId, locale }`, the tab is labelled by the module's
`<module>.productTemplateTab` message and addressed as `tab=<module>`.

## Creating a record

A collection's create action opens the **same** record modal as its rows, with no record yet. There is
no create page and no separate create modal.

```
# File: URL shape of a create action
/admin/<collection>?<list state>&record=<kind>:new&tab=<tab>
```

- Build the link with `recordModalCreateHref(url, { kind, tab })`. `new` (`RECORD_NEW_ID`) is reserved:
  a kind whose ids could literally be `new` must not use this contract.
- The runtime calls the context read **without an id** (`{}`) and sets `context.creating = true`.
  `<module>.<kind>.modalContext` then returns the empty record's defaults, the choices its form needs
  and the viewer's `permissions` (a viewer who may not create gets a refusal, not an empty form).
  A definition that needs another input shape uses `context.input(id, creating)`.
- Views branch on `context.creating`: hide tabs that need an existing record (members, history…),
  title the modal for creation, and name the create command in the form.
- The create command is the module's existing save function. Give it `after: 'open'`: on success the
  runtime reads the new id (`created(value)`, else the value's `id`), replaces the `:new` history
  entry with the created record and opens it on `openTab` (or the first tab). Without an id it closes.
  `ket:records-changed` carries the created id, so the collection behind refreshes.
- A child that only exists once the record does (a team's members, a programme's milestones) is added
  after the switch, inside the created record's modal.

## Runtime labels

The runtime shows these labels before a record's context has loaded, so a module passes them in the
page's language through `labels` (an object or a function returning one). The context's `messages`
override them once loaded, the last record's messages carry over while the next one loads, and the
runtime keeps English defaults (`RECORD_MODAL_LABELS`) so a reader never sees a key. Contexts should
still ship the same keys in `messages`:

| Key | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `recordModal.close` | Close control label |
| `recordModal.loading` | Loading state and provisional title |
| `recordModal.loadFailed` | The record could not be read |
| `recordModal.notFound` | The record is gone or not visible |
| `recordModal.retry` | Retry after a load failure |
| `recordModal.errorTitle` | Title of the refusal notice |
| `recordModal.saveFailed` | A command failed without issues, or with a code nothing translates |
| `recordModal.savedTitle` | Title of the notice a succeeded command leaves |
| `recordModal.saved` | A command succeeded and the modal stayed open |
| `recordModal.unsaved` | Prompt before discarding typed input |
| `recordModal.uploadFailed` | A file could not be stored |

## Building the island

Author the definition in TSX and bundle it with esbuild into the module's asset root. Keep
`@ketvietlab/ketjs-view` external (it is served at `/_ket/view/`) and bundle
`@ketvietlab/design-system` and `@ketvietlab/ketsuite/ui` in, so the island shares the page's single
renderer and renders the same markup the design-system CSS expects.


### Inline photo cells

Use `RecordModalForm` with `dropzone: true`, an upload command, and a public `DropZone` in `body`.
Selecting a file and dropping a file both submit that form through the record runtime. The runtime
owns uploads, errors, busy state, and the subsequent context refresh. Keep each cell a separate form;
placing the photo matrix inside a note or completion form creates invalid nested forms. File controls
need no module-specific event handler or private design-system attributes.


### Pending actions and inline editors

`recordModalHref(url, { kind, id, tab, dialog })` optionally names an entry dialog with the
`recordDialog` query parameter. The runtime reads the record first and opens only a dialog declared
by that record definition. Opening the dialog performs no mutation: its command still validates
permissions, current version, and fields. This is appropriate for kanban drop confirmation. A normal
record link clears the entry dialog; closing clears it with the record cursor. Do not implement a
second overlay or write on drop.

`RecordStateTrigger({ name, value, children })` wraps a public button to select a record-local view
state, such as the active milestone note editor. The runtime retains form drafts before changing
state. Give editors for different records distinct field names so switching editors never reuses the
wrong draft. For an inline Cancel action, pass `resetFields: [name]` to discard only that
editor's draft while preserving other fields and tabs. State triggers do not save a record.

Desktop `fixedHeight` is carried by `--kv-modal-fixed-height`; it never overrides the mobile full-screen height. Avoid inline `height: … !important` on a ModalSheet.

## Record pages

Product templates open on their own page: `/admin/product/templates/{id}`, and
`/admin/product/templates/new` for the create action. The record is still rendered client side. General and Attributes & variants are peer Surface cards,
shown together without page tabs; each form keeps its own save action.

```
# File: URL shape of a record page
/admin/<collection>/<id>?tab=<tab>
/admin/<collection>/new
```

- The module declares the island with `defineRecordPageIsland({ kind, client, export })` and its client
  exports `createRecordPage(definition, { path: (id) => '/admin/<collection>/' + id })`. The definition
  is the one a modal would use: context read, tabs, commands, dialogs and drafts are unchanged.
- The page route renders the shell without a top bar or title and places the island through a joint
  with `{ id, tab, title, loading, back, width }`. The island's server view is `recordPageLoading(props)`:
  a `RecordPage` holding a `LoadingState`. The first client render is the same markup, so hydration
  adopts it, then the runtime reads the context and renders the record. The route answers 404 for an
  unknown id before rendering anything.
- `context.presentation` is `'page'`. Views use it to place controls: a page's actions sit in its header,
  so a menu opens downward, and its close trigger reads as the way back to the collection.
- Closing (the close trigger, or a command with `after: 'close'`) navigates to `back` through the shell's
  own link handling. Switching tabs replaces the address in place; back and forward belong to the shell.
- A command with `after: 'open'` on the create page replaces `new` in the address with the created id.
- Nothing outside the page turns inert, and Escape and Tab are trapped only while a nested dialog is
  open.
- A successful command announces `ket:records-changed` with `page: true`. The page reads its own
  context again, so the shell does not re-fetch the route behind it.
- Links from the modal era (`?record=<kind>:<id>`) on the collection redirect to the page.

## Record pages for administration profiles

A profile the reader studies, links to and returns to lives at `/admin/<things>/{id}` as a
`RecordPage` (56rem, no tabs). It reuses the record runtime, so dialogs, commands, drafts and
refusals behave exactly as in the modal.

1. Declare the island with `defineRecordPageIsland({ kind, client, export })`. Its props are
   `{ id, title, loadingLabel, trail?, trailLabel?, envelope? }`, keyed by `id`.
2. The detail route calls the module's `modalContext` itself and passes the result as `envelope`,
   with the collection's `returnTo` as the last trail link. The server writes `recordPageShell`,
   the client adopts the same markup and then shows the record without another request.
3. The client exports `createRecordPage(definition)`: the modal definition without `header` and
   `tabs`, with `body` for the blocks — one titled `Surface` each, returned as siblings so the page
   owns the gap between them — and `pageActions` for the header's commands.
4. Rows link to the page with the collection's state in `returnTo`. Creating stays a modal over the
   collection; its command `navigate`s to the new page. `?record=<kind>:<id>` redirects to the page.

`close`, `reload`, `open` and tab afters only close the top dialog; the page itself never closes,
and `ket:records-changed` for its id reloads it in place.
