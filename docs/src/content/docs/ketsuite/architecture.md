description: Understand KetSuite composition, module layers, runtime boundaries, and package ownership.
---

KetSuite is assembled explicitly in `packages/ketsuite/src/deployment.ts`. There is no import-time module
registry: `createKetsuiteDeployment()` passes the complete module list to `defineDeployment()`, and KetJS composes it
into the manifest used by migration, permissions, HTTP dispatch, workers, and rendering.

## Three module layers

KetSuite module names encode an ownership pattern, not a mandatory framework feature.

| Layer | Typical name | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | `partner`, `sale`, `loyalty` | Models, invariants, functions, jobs, reports, domain messages | Admin-only markup or another domain's integration policy |
| Backend | `partner_backend`, `sale_backend` | `/admin/...` routes, screens, menus, islands, backend translations | Duplicate business rules or direct writes around domain functions |
| Bridge | `account_partner`, `loyalty_sale` | Behavior that is meaningful only when two modules are selected | A patch hidden inside either domain owner |

Shared capability modules such as `backend`, `mail`, `activity`, `calendar`, `storage`, `user`, and
`channel_api` provide contracts used by several verticals. Website modules and themes form a separate
presentation vertical but obey the same dependency rules.

  partner_backend["partner_backend"] --> partner["partner"]
  partner_backend --> backend["backend"]
  account_partner["account_partner"] --> partner
  account_partner --> account["account"]
  account_partner_backend["account_partner_backend"] --> account_partner
  account_partner_backend --> backend
```

The bridge keeps `partner` usable without accounting and prevents `account` from importing partner
implementation details. The backend bridge follows the same rule for its screen contribution.

## Module families in the packaged deployment

The deployment composition groups capabilities by dependency direction. This map is an orientation
aid; the `modules` array in `deployment.ts` remains the executable inventory.

| Family | Domain and capability modules | Companion pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web and channels | `website`, `channel_api`, `website_menu`, `website_seo`, `website_search`, `website_form` | Website backend plus hospitality and retail website bridges |
| Identity and organization | `address`, `partner`, `company`, `user`, `oauth`, `hr`, `attendance` | One backend companion per management surface; accounting is linked through `account_partner` |
| Collaboration | `mail`, `mail_transport`, `mail_inbound`, `activity`, `calendar` | Backend modules plus model-specific mail, inbound, activity, and calendar bridges |
| Product and stock | `uom`, `product`, `product_media`, `pricing`, `stock` | Product, pricing, and stock backends; mail and activity bridges attach collaboration |
| Commercial flow | `purchase`, `sale`, `pos` | Separate backends; Sale connects to CRM, loyalty, mail, activity, stock, pricing, and accounting through dependencies or bridges |
| Finance and reporting | `account`, `report` | Accounting and report backends plus partner, mail, and activity bridges |
| Growth | `crm`, `loyalty` | CRM and loyalty backends with Sale, POS, and Website bridges |
| Industry verticals | `hospitality_core` | Website and theme integrations compose hospitality behavior without moving it into generic commerce modules |

Several backend modules intentionally depend on the shared `backend` module, while domain modules do
not. This makes headless composition possible and prevents admin presentation from becoming a hidden
requirement of business logic.

## Declared and running

A KetSuite deployment has one state: every module in its `modules` array participates in composition,
schema migration, HTTP behavior, and worker behavior. There is no bootstrap list or per-database module
lifecycle. Product variants are separate deployment declarations with explicit module lists.

Backend companions remain separate bridge modules so headless deployments can select the business
module without its screens. A deployment needing the admin selects both modules explicitly.

## Deployment-owned runtime policy

The deployment declaration owns policy that no individual module can decide safely:

- datastore selection and SQLite defaults;
- default and fallback locale;
- default timezone;
- worker queue concurrency;
- anonymous-session defaults;
- staff-session resolution and permission lookup;
- customer versus anonymous audience resolution;
- website page resolvers and the site title.

Keep domain functions independent of these deployment defaults. They should consume `ctx.scope`, the
active locale, declared transports, and framework services rather than reading process-wide state.

## Composition order is a contract

KetJS validates dependencies and produces a topological order; source-array position is still kept
readable so humans can audit the application. Add a module close to its domain and companions. A module
may contribute to another module's joint, reserved route prefix, or model only through a declared
dependency and the owner's published contract.

When a new feature crosses domains, prefer this decision sequence:

1. Put an invariant used by only one domain in that domain module.
2. Put presentation for that domain in its backend or website companion.
3. Put behavior requiring two independently useful domains in a bridge module.
4. Promote a helper to the package public API only when an external module needs the same boundary.

This keeps composition graphs meaningful and makes accidental circular dependencies visible at
composition time.

## Durable Sale lifecycle events

The `sale` domain appends one `sale.OrderLifecycleEvent` when an order first reaches `confirmed`,
`shipped`, `delivered`, or `cancelled`. The event is written by the same domain command that changes
the order whenever that command already owns a transaction. Its company, order, and phase key is
unique, so retrying `sale.confirmOrder`, `sale.syncDeliveries`, or `sale.cancelOrder` cannot publish a
duplicate fact.

This table is a domain outbox, not a customer-care implementation. Optional bridge and private modules
may read it and maintain their own consumption receipts. They must not update or delete Sale's event
rows, and Sale must not depend on those consumers. A consumer should keep a slower reconciliation path
for legacy rows and for failures between an external stock mutation and `sale.syncDeliveries`.
