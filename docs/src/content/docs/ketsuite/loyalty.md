# Loyalty

KetSuite Loyalty is split by responsibility while keeping one public business contract:

- `loyalty` owns programs, rules, rewards, wallets/cards, the immutable ledger, reservations, tiers,
  earn groups and memberships.
- `loyalty_sale` adapts quotations and Sales Orders to the Loyalty order snapshot and materializes
  reward lines.
- `loyalty_pos` adapts POS orders, payment, refunds and reward lines.
- `loyalty_backend` provides one Loyalty application for configuration, reporting, Sale/POS actions
  and the read-only customer summary.

All four modules ship Vietnamese and English catalogues from their first revision. Business values
such as a program name or reward description remain user data and are not translated implicitly.

## Accounting and concurrency invariants

- A wallet balance changes only through an immutable ledger entry. Earn, issue, redeem, refund,
  adjustment, expiry and reversal remain distinct operations.
- `sourceKey` is unique inside a company, so retrying a command cannot duplicate a ledger effect.
- A draft Sale/POS order reserves points. Removing the reward or cancelling a draft releases the
  reservation; confirmation/payment settles it.
- Cancellation and refunds append reversal entries instead of deleting history.
- Reservation uses a transaction and compare-and-set update. Competing requests cannot reserve
  more than the available balance.
- Each company tier owns its spend threshold and rolling window. The window is a positive whole
  number of months, so an operator can define a tier such as 10,000,000 over ten years (`120`) while
  another tier uses six or twelve months. A month-end cutoff clamps to the last valid day of the
  target month. Loyalty programs do not own tier criteria and promotions do not apply implicitly
  from a tier. When several tiers qualify, the highest sequence wins, then the highest threshold.
  Earn groups are evaluated by priority and stable id order.
- The redeem cap is based on eligible untaxed product lines after commercial discounts and before
  Loyalty reward lines.

Sale and POS lines carry `lineKind=product|shipping|reward` plus Loyalty application, reward and
point-cost metadata. POS accounting uses the signed line subtotal, so a negative reward line reduces
revenue rather than creating an unbalanced entry.

Gift-card and eWallet money is not a reward discount. A currency wallet uses a dedicated
stored-value reservation keyed by the caller's source identity. Capture reserves value;
successful settlement finalizes one debit; cancellation releases the reservation; a
refund appends a credit; expiry appends a debit for the remaining unreserved balance.
Membership summaries aggregate point wallets only; currency balances never appear as points.
The generated wallet code is only an opaque authority alias. A channel that accepts a
customer-facing token owns its hash, pepper and masked presentation outside Loyalty and
must never store the raw token in a wallet, ledger entry or command result.

The Loyalty balance is the instrument subledger, while Account owns the financial
liability. A composing module commits the wallet transition with its operational state
and supplies the matching Account move/payment source. It must reconcile those two
authorities; neither one silently repairs the other.

## Public function boundary

The stable functions are:

- `loyalty.program.list/get/save/archive`
- `loyalty.evaluateOrder`
- `loyalty.applyCode`
- `loyalty.applyReward/removeReward`
- `loyalty.wallet.get/adjust`
- `loyalty.membership.refresh/getSummary`
- `loyalty.order.finalize/reverse`
- `loyalty.storedValue.open/issue/reserve/finalize/release/refund/expire`

Sale and POS adapters expose the same actions with an `orderId` input. The portal derives its partner
from the signed-in session and never accepts a caller-supplied actor.

## Validation

Acceptance tests boot the real app on a temporary port with an isolated SQLite database and storage.
Setup uses named fixture calls; all behavior under test crosses HTTP with the real session cookie and
company context. The suite drains the durable worker for wallet expiry and membership refresh.

A separate live PostgreSQL test races two connections against one wallet and verifies one reservation
winner, non-negative balance and idempotent finalization. The repository gate also runs build,
TypeScript, i18n parity, zero-dependency audit, UI audit and type proofs.

Visual acceptance uses seeded application data rather than mocks.

## Tier management

The tier screen owns company-wide tiers, with a spend threshold and rolling window on each tier. It does not duplicate
the partner directory: customers, employees and suppliers remain Partner records, while Loyalty
membership is a concern shown from the relevant customer record. Completed Sale and POS product
lines contribute to spend; reversals and returns remove the corresponding value.
If every tier is archived, refreshing a customer removes the obsolete membership projection.

Submitting a tier form follows the shared KetSuite form contract. A rejected submit
keeps the operator's raw input and associates each validation message with its field. Selecting a
tier row opens its edit dialog. Archive and restore are separate commands and therefore do not run
the edit-form schema.

## Deliberate non-scope

Website checkout is not enabled in this PR. `/my/loyalty` is read-only. No the domain contract history importer is
provided; state begins in KetSuite and future backfills must be idempotent and support dry-run.
