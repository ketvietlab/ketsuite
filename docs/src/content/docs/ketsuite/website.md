# Website

## Administration collections

Website administration lists place Create beside the title, followed by URL-backed filters,
tool actions, and KetTable. Existing site, status, search, and paging controls retain their route
contracts. Revision, taxonomy, media, redirect, publication, member, domain, and site-health lists also support text search.
Revision comparison still receives every revision, and domain readiness still receives
every domain, even when search narrows the primary table. Search cannot change the selected
revision, primary-domain evidence, or a refused form's submitted draft.

Inline member/domain/redirect/publication forms, submission export and retention forms,
revision diffs, and detail tables remain specialized content within those screens.

KetSuite Website is the public content surface: sites, domains, pages and posts, revisions and
publication, media, menus, forms, and the customer account that goes with them. Business facts stay
with the domain that owns them — price and stock in Sale and Stock, stays in Hospitality, cases in
CRM — and Website composes them through optional bridge modules.

## Modules

- `website`: sites, domains, site membership, entries and revisions, taxonomy, media metadata,
  redirects, preview tokens, and the customer realm.
- `website_backend`: the Website Studio at `/website`. Auto-installs once `backend` is present. The
  server-rendered admin under `/admin/website` that the sections below sometimes describe is removed.
- `website_menu`: navigation items a theme can place.
- `website_seo`: per-entry metadata, and the public `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` projection.
- `website_search`: the search box a theme can place, over published entries.
- `website_theme`: the registry of a company's own themes, with CSS and a browser module. See
  [Company themes](#company-themes).
- `website_form`: versioned public forms and their submissions.
- `website_form_mail`: optional bridge that tells a form's owner a request arrived.
- `website_retail`, `website_hospitality`, `crm_website`: optional bridges to the owning domain.

## Publishing a set

`publishEntry` flips one entry's pointer the moment someone presses the button on it, so a set of
related changes reaches visitors piecemeal — a page whose menu link is not there yet, or a link to a
page that is not published. A **publication** freezes which revision of which entry goes out, and
activating it moves all of them or none.

```ts
// File: examples/website/publish.ts
await ctx.call('website.preparePublication', {
  id: 'pub-2026-09-05',
  siteId: 'moc',
  entryIds: ['gioi-thieu', 'chuyen-ben-am-tra'],
})
// Nothing is public yet — a prepared publication is a proposal.
await ctx.call('website.activatePublication', {
  id: 'pub-2026-09-05',
  expectedPublicationId: '', // what was active when the reviewer looked
})
```

Both paths stay. A site that publishes one page at a time is not doing anything wrong, and this does
not take that away.

### The outbox, and its first consumer

WEB-014 asks for "CAS pointer + outbox atomic". The atomic half is already there and does not need a
table: `ctx.tx` hands its body a context bound to the transaction's own connection, and
`jobs.enqueue` queues through that context's adapter — so a job enqueued inside an activation would
commit with it, and an activation that loses the compare-and-set would queue nothing.

What is missing is a **consumer**. There is no cache to invalidate, no physical search index to
rebuild, and no delivery to make off the back of a publication. Enqueuing a job nobody handles would
be a mechanism pretending to be a feature, so nothing is queued today — and a test asserts that, so
adding one is a deliberate change rather than a silent one.

The search index is that consumer, and it sidesteps the dependency question rather than answering it:
`website` still cannot depend on `website_search`, so instead of being pushed at activation the index
notices on read that the active publication has changed. Nothing is enqueued, nothing is wired, and a
site that never searches never pays for an index.

A push would still be better for a large site, where the first search after a publication does the
catching up. That needs either a consumer `website` may depend on, or deployment wiring of the kind
`serve.pages.menuResolve` uses.

### What else goes out with the pages

A publication carries an `attachments` bag keyed by module name, and `website` does not read it. The
navigation has to be able to go out with the pages it points at — otherwise a link appears before the
page it points at, or a page arrives with no way to reach it — but `website_menu` depends on
`website`, not the other way round. So the slot is opaque, and the module that owns a key is the only
thing that reads it.

```ts
// File: examples/website/publish-with-menu.ts
const menu = await ctx.call('website_menu.snapshotMenu', { siteId: 'moc' })
await ctx.call('website.preparePublication', {
  id: 'pub-2026-09-05',
  siteId: 'moc',
  entryIds: ['gioi-thieu'],
  attachments: { website_menu: menu },
})
```

`website_menu.publicMenu` then reads the frozen navigation while that publication is active, and an
edit made afterwards stays in the editor's view until the next publication carries it out. A site that
has never prepared a publication reads live rows, which is what every site did before publications
existed.

Attachments are part of the content hash, so the same pages with a different menu is a different
publication rather than a replay.

### Metadata that travels, and metadata that does not

A description, a canonical and a share image describe a particular revision of a page, so they are
frozen into the publication alongside the revision. Saving a new description used to rewrite what was
public immediately, with no publication involved at all; it now waits for the next one, while the
editor's own view shows what they saved.

`noindex` is deliberately **not** frozen. It is not a description of the page, it is an instruction to
stop showing it — and an instruction to stop should not wait for a publication to take effect. It is
read live in the head and in the sitemap alike, so a delist is immediate everywhere.

Because the SEO fields sit on the entry that `website` owns, they need no attachment: they are frozen
into the publication's own entry list, next to the revision they describe.

### The site pointer is the concurrency token

Activation moves `Site.activePublicationId` under compare-and-set **before** it touches any entry.
Two activations that both started from the same base would otherwise each believe they replaced the
other, and the entry pointers would end up a mix of the two. The loser gets
`website.error.publicationStaleBase` and has run nothing.

Pass `expectedPublicationId` to say which base the reviewer was looking at; omit it to accept whatever
is current.

### What a publication refuses, and how

Preparing names the entry in every refusal — a caller publishing twenty pages needs to know which one
is the problem, not that "an entry" was wrong. An entry outside the site, in the trash, or without a
current revision stops the whole prepare, and nothing is written.

Preparing the same set twice under the same id returns what was prepared; the set is identified by a
hash over `entryId:revisionId`, so ordering is not identity. The same id for a *different* set is
`website.error.publicationConflict`. Replaying an activation is not an error — it already happened.

### Rollback is a publication

Going back prepares the previous set again rather than undoing. The history stays, and the entries go
through the same activation the forward direction does — so a page trashed since it was last public
does not come back by the side door.

### Nothing goes live that cannot be drawn

`saveEntry` checked a layout against the sections that exist. Nothing else did.

That left five paths to live content taking the stored layout as given: `publishEntry`,
`preparePublication`, `activatePublication`, `rollbackPublication`, and the entry pointers those move.
So a page placing a section from a module the deployment has since dropped could be made live, and
`E_UNKNOWN_SECTION` would be raised in the renderer — at a visitor, as a five hundred, rather than at
the editor who could have fixed it. A publication makes it worse rather than better: it moves a whole
set at once, so one page referencing a vanished section takes every page in the set down with it.

**`publishEntry` refuses**, and the refusal carries the layout errors and the path, so an editor is
told which section rather than that something is wrong.

**`preparePublication` refuses and names the entry** — a caller publishing twenty pages needs to know
which one. It checks at prepare rather than at activate because prepare is where the caller can still
fix the page.

**`activatePublication` checks again**, because a deployment can drop a module between preparing and
activating and that is the moment content reaches visitors. It does not re-read the set: preparing
records `Publication.sectionTypes`, the distinct section types the frozen entries place, so the last
gate costs one pass over a handful of names. `rollbackPublication` carries that list forward, and
computes it where the base publication predates the column — otherwise rolling back to an older
publication would produce a set the gate has nothing to check.

**`restoreRevision` is deliberately not gated.** A restore makes a draft; it moves
`currentRevisionId` and never touches `publishedRevisionId`, so it does not change what a visitor
reads. Refusing it would trap an editor with a page they can neither recover nor repair — getting the
old content back is how the missing section gets replaced. The gate that matters still refuses to
publish it.

`website.preflightPublication` runs the same check without publishing anything. Given `entryIds` it
checks those; given none it checks every page on the site that is not in the bin, which is the
question an operator actually asks after a deployment changes. It answers `ok`, how many pages were
looked at, and the ones that would break with their errors.

An unnamed run reads a thousand pages and reports `capped` beyond that, and a capped run is **never**
`ok` however clean the pages it reached were: a partial scan cannot answer "is this site safe to
publish" with yes. Naming what it did find is still worth more than refusing to answer at all.

## SEO and the public projection

`website_seo` adds four optional fields to an entry it does not own — `metaDescription`, `canonical`,
`noindex` and `ogImage` — and declares the `website:page.head` fill that would render them. Because
the module declares the fields, it also owns writing them: `website.saveEntry` deliberately does not,
so SEO validation does not end up inside the content module.

The head metadata travels with the page it describes: `website.getEntryByPath` returns a `meta`
object and the storefront hands it to the theme, which is what the `website:page.head` fill
interpolates. `meta` carries an **allowlist** — `metaDescription`, `canonical`, `noindex`, `ogImage` —
rather than the row, because a theme is untrusted presentation and modules extend `website.Entry` for
their own purposes. A field that was never set is absent rather than sent as null.

```ts
// File: examples/website/seo.ts
await ctx.call('website_seo.saveEntrySeo', {
  entryId: 'entry-1',
  metaDescription: 'Trà và gốm thủ công.',
  canonical: '/gioi-thieu',
  noindex: false,
})
```

### Every field is a partial update

`saveEntrySeo` writes only the fields the caller passed. Writing all four on every call meant that
setting `noindex` erased the description — and, in the direction that matters, that editing a
description silently cleared `noindex` and re-listed a page someone had deliberately delisted. Pass
an explicit `null` to clear a field.

### A canonical may only point back at its own site

`canonical` accepts a site-relative path, or an absolute URL whose host is one of that site's own
domains. Anything else is refused as a validation error rather than stored: a canonical naming a
foreign host hands the site's ranking to whoever owns that host, which is a permission decision.
A protocol-relative value such as `//other.example/x` reads as a path and is not one, so it is
refused as well — and so are `/\other.example/x` and a value with an interior tab, CR or LF, because a
browser normalises a backslash to a slash for http(s) and strips those control characters before
parsing. Testing for a leading `//` alone let all of them through. Credentials in an absolute
canonical are refused rather than published.

### Reserved namespaces

The reserved namespaces are **derived from the composed manifest**, not hardcoded: the first segment
of every registered route, plus `/api` and `/internal/v1`, which are reserved as families rather than
registered as single paths. A hardcoded list drifts from the routes that actually answer — a page
published at `/login` would be advertised in the sitemap while the `user` module serves that path.

The comparison is per path segment: `/administrative-notes` is an ordinary page that merely begins
with the same letters as `/admin`, and delisting it would quietly remove real content. Because
`robots.txt` itself matches by character prefix, each namespace is emitted as both a subtree rule and
an anchored exact rule.

### Two public files

| Path | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `/robots.txt` | Disallows the reserved namespaces and points at the sitemap. `/_theme/` is allowed instead, so a crawler renders a themed page the way a visitor sees it. A host that resolves to no site — including the synthetic `__legacy__` site `resolveSite` returns while a company has no active site at all — disallows everything, so content being prepared is not discovered first. |
| `/sitemap.xml` | Lists the published entries of the site that owns the request host. Returns 404 when the host resolves to no site. |

Both answer in the origin the request arrived on. Naming a different canonical host would contradict
the domain the site actually answers.

### The sitemap filter is the publication

An entry appears in the sitemap when its site is **active**, it has a published revision, it is not
in trash, it is not marked `noindex`, and it does not sit under a reserved namespace. There is no
separate sitemap switch to keep in step: unpublishing a page or marking it `noindex` removes it from
the sitemap by the same act.

The publication filter is part of the query rather than applied after it. Applied as a plain row
limit over a path ordering, a site with enough drafts sorting before its published pages returned an
empty sitemap while those pages existed.

`sitemapEntries` is `exposure: 'internal'`. The two public files are the entry point and they resolve
the site from the request host; left directly callable, an anonymous caller could name any site in
the company and read the published paths of a site that is not being served yet.

## Company themes

A Studio site uses one of the bundled presets unless its company has a theme of its own. A company
theme is a flat package, checked at install, kept in the `website_theme` registry, and served from the
tenant's KetJS storage:

```text
# File: themes/acme (package layout)
theme.json    manifest: engine website-theme/1, key, version, tier private, title, settings, frame, script
theme.css     every selector under [data-site-theme="<key>"]
frame-*.ktl   optional KTL fragments for topbar, header, footer, beforeMain, afterMain
theme.mjs     optional browser module exporting mount(root, ctx)
*.svg|png|jpg|webp|avif|woff2   files the stylesheet names by bare file name
```

Metadata and validated frame sources go into the database so public delivery can render synchronously.
The files go through the `Storage` abstraction under
`website-theme/<key>/<versionId>/`, so a self-hosted server on the `local` driver needs no bucket, CDN
or public URL; S3-compatible Object Storage works the same way.

### Install, offer, withdraw

Installing is an operator's step, not a tenant role's. Két Việt runs it for its customers; on a
self-hosted server it is whoever runs the server:

```bash
# Run from: a KetSuite deployment checkout
ketsuite theme install ./themes/acme --company acme-co --available
ket provision website_theme.setThemeVersionStatus --input - <<< '{"id":"<versionId>","status":"revoked"}'
```

`installWebsiteTheme` and `installThemePackage` do the same from code, for a deployment with its own
CLI or tenant databases. An install checks the package, records the version as `staged`, writes the
files, then marks it `installed`. Running it again with the same files is a no-op; the same key and
version with other files is refused, because a version once installed never changes. A version is
`installed`, then `available`, then possibly `revoked`. Only an `available` version can be chosen or
served.

Install refuses a package that could reach beyond its own site root:

| Refusal | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `cssScope` | A selector not under `[data-site-theme="<key>"]`, or one that styles what follows the root (`+`, `~`). |
| `cssImport`, `cssUrl` | `@import`, a remote or `data:` URL, or a file the package does not contain. |
| `cssAtRule`, `cssKeyframes` | Global at-rules such as `@property`, and keyframes not prefixed `<key>-`. |
| `scriptBudget`, `scriptUndeclared` | A module over its gzip budget (120 KB unless the manifest lowers or raises it, at most 256 KB), or a module the manifest does not declare. |
| `frameMissing`, `frameUndeclared`, `frameInvalid` | A declared frame file is absent, an undeclared frame file is present, or its KTL/HTML is unsafe. |
| `fileName`, `fileType` | A nested or upper-case name, a name starting with `_`, or a type outside the list above. |

### Choosing and applying

`website_theme.listThemes` offers the bundled presets and the company's themes at their newest
available version. `website_theme.selectTheme` writes the choice and its settings into the site's
style, under the same revision check as `website.saveStudioStyle`. A later style save keeps it. A
successful save applies to all published pages immediately, while page content still has its own
publish step. Rolling back a page revision does not roll back the site theme. `versionId: null` returns the site to its
preset. Choosing needs the `website.themes` role; the theme runs code on the site, so it is not part of
`website.designer`.

In the Studio, the site's **Giao diện** page lists the company's themes under the style form, for an
actor the bootstrap grants `website.theme.select`. That capability needs both functions above, and
the deployment composing `website_theme`. A designer chooses a theme there, edits its settings, moves
to a newer version of the theme in use (keeping the settings it still declares), or returns to the
preset. A setting can name itself for the Studio in the manifest:

```jsonc
// File: themes/acme/theme.json (excerpt)
"settings": {
  "tone": { "type": "enum", "values": ["warm", "cool"], "label": "Tông màu", "labels": { "warm": "Ấm", "cool": "Lạnh" } },
  "banner": { "type": "bool", "default": true, "label": "Hiện dải thông báo" }
}
```

`label` and each of `labels` are 1 to 80 characters, and `labels` may only name declared values.
Without them the Studio shows the setting's name and raw values.

### What the page gets

A themed page adds, after `public.css`, the theme's stylesheet and `data-site-theme="<key>"` on the
site root. Declared KTL frame slots replace only their matching native shell slots; Builder shows
the same frame without making header or footer draggable. It also answers with a
`content-security-policy` whose `script-src` is `'self'`, with the
manifest's `connect` and `frame` origins added. The browser module loads through a generated
`/_theme/<versionId>/_boot.mjs`, which calls `mount(root, ctx)` with the site root and a frozen
context: `settings`, `locale`, `page`, and `asset(file)`. The module is left out when the request is a
preview, carries a staff session, or reached a host that did not resolve to the site's own domain. The
page is complete without it.

Files are answered with `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, `nosniff` and a
sandboxing policy of their own. Revoking a version makes its files answer 404 at once; published pages
keep their markup and fall back to `public.css`. A deployment with a CDN in front also purges
`/_theme/<versionId>/` there.

## Navigation menus

`website_menu` holds one tree of items per site. The tree carries the same integrity contract as the
taxonomy tree in `website`, because an editor who can build one expects the other to behave the same
way.

- **No cycles.** Reparenting walks the ancestor chain, not just the immediate parent. Making A a child
  of B and then B a child of A is refused with `website_menu.error.menuCycle`; previously only
  self-parenting was caught, and the loop surfaced in whatever tried to render the tree.
- **Bounded depth.** An item may have at most 100 ancestors, which also bounds the walk.
- **No orphans.** Deleting an item that still has children is refused with
  `website_menu.error.menuInUse`, mirroring `website.deleteTerm`. Remove or reparent the children
  first; the alternative — silently rehoming a subtree — moves content the editor cannot see.

A parent belonging to a different site remains `website.error.invalidParent`.

### Navigation that points somewhere

`validHref` checks the *shape* of a menu link — it starts with `/`, it has no backslash, no control
characters, no credentials — and stops there. Nothing ever asked whether the path names a page.

So a menu item could point at `/bang-gia` when no page serves that path, and the site's own navigation
walked a visitor into its own 404. Nobody noticed, because a menu item and the page it names are
edited on different screens on different days.

`website_menu.preflightMenu` answers it. An internal link is satisfied by a **published** page at that
path or by a route the deployment serves — `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` are links a menu may
legitimately carry and neither is an entry. A trailing slash, a query and a fragment all name the same
page.

**Published, not merely present.** A link to a draft is the harder version of the bug: it answers for
the editor, who is logged in and can see the draft, and 404s for everyone else.

**External links are left alone.** Whether another site answers is not a question this can ask, and
pretending to answer it would be worse than saying nothing.

It reports rather than refuses, and names every broken link rather than the first. A menu is built
alongside the pages it points at, so a link that does not resolve *yet* is an ordinary state of an
afternoon's work — the point is that nobody has to remember to look.

### Why this is not a gate on the publication

`preparePublication` refuses a page it cannot draw, and it would be natural to expect it to refuse a
publication whose navigation points outside the set it freezes. It cannot, and the reason is the shape
of the publication itself.

The frozen navigation lives in `Publication.attachments`, which is **opaque to `website` by design**:
`website_menu` depends on `website` and not the other way round, so the module that owns a key is the
only thing that reads it. Teaching `preparePublication` to read the menu attachment would invert the
dependency the whole publication design rests on — the same constraint that put the navigation in an
attachment rather than a column in the first place.

So the check lives in the module that owns the data, and the two preflights are run side by side
before preparing. That is honest about what it is: a thing you look at, not a thing that stops you.
Closing it properly needs a way for a module to register a check against a publication it contributes
an attachment to, which is a framework seam rather than a website change.

### Navigation has to reach the page

A theme draws `{% for item in menu %}`. Nothing ever put a menu in that scope, so every public page
rendered an empty nav — the items were stored, editable, and invisible.

Navigation belongs to the site rather than to the page, so it is resolved beside it:
`serve.pages.menuResolve` names the function, the way `siteResolve` and `resolve` already do, and its
answer reaches the theme as `menu`. The framework names no module; the deployment points it at
`website_menu.publicMenu`, and a deployment that names a function no composed module declares fails at
boot rather than rendering a blank nav.

`publicMenu` is separate from `listMenu` rather than a loosening of it. `listMenu` is the editor's
view, scoped by site membership, and a visitor has no membership to scope by. The public one answers
only for a site that is actually being served — the same gate the sitemap and public search apply —
and returns only what a theme needs to draw a link.

### Pre-existing damage is not this edit's problem

Only the parent the caller named is validated. The rest of the chain is walked for one reason: to see
whether *this* edit would close a loop back to *this* item.

That distinction matters because menus can already hold broken chains — the delete this module used
to allow orphaned children. Validating the whole stored chain would refuse an edit two levels below
the damage, report `parentId` as invalid while naming a parent that is perfectly fine, and point at
nothing that needs repair. A chain that is already broken, or already looping above, cannot close a
loop through this item either, so the walk stops rather than refusing. Existing orphans are therefore
harmless, and the delete guard stops new ones appearing.

## Telling an operator a request arrived

`mail_transport` already owns the outbox — `Delivery`, retry, dead-letter, provider events — so
`website_form` keeps no delivery state of its own and no second ledger appears. `website_form_mail` is
only the bridge, and `website_form_mail.notifySubmission` queues one notification per submission,
keyed by the submission id so a retry sends nothing new.

### The notification carries nothing the visitor wrote

The mail says which form, on which site, when, and where to open it. That is a deliberate boundary,
not a default nobody chose:

- **A `Delivery` stores an immutable body snapshot.** Mailing the payload would persist contact data a
  second time, in another module, in a row that cannot be edited or purged — while the submission
  itself is under a retention policy that promises exactly that. The purge gate could never close.
- **`Form.notifyTo` is checked for the shape of an email address and nothing else.** Anyone who may
  edit a form may point it anywhere. With a bare notification, doing so leaks that a form was
  submitted; with the payload, it is a standing export of everyone's contact details.
- **The consent notice does not mention an email copy**, and under the versioning contract above,
  changing it to say so would invalidate every page currently open.

Two independent guards hold the line. The bridge builds its context **from** an allowlist rather than
filtering a record **into** one — `SAFE_KEYS` is `siteTitle`, `formName`, `submissionId`, `receivedAt`
and `adminUrl` — so a field added to a form tomorrow cannot appear. And `mail_transport` refuses to
save a template that references a key outside its own allowlist, before any mail can be queued
against it.

Widening this later is additive: a template may ask for more once `SAFE_KEYS` grows. Narrowing it is
not — mail that has been sent cannot be recalled from a mailbox, a forward, or a provider's storage.

### Triggering is explicit

`notifySubmission` takes the `submissionId`, the `templateId` and the `baseUrl` the link is built
from, the same shape `calendar_mail_transport.sendInvitations` uses. It is not called from
`submitForm`: `website_form` must not depend on `mail_transport`, and the framework has no commit hook
that would let the bridge observe a write without that dependency. Outbox administration also
requires a signed-in user, which an anonymous submission does not have.

## Public site search

`website.searchPublished` matches a term against the **published** title and excerpt of each entry.
Those live on the revision rather than the entry, so a draft title is never searchable and a result
always shows what a visitor would actually see.

- The publication filter is part of the query. Unpublished entries used to be fetched and discarded,
  spending the scan window before the published ones were reached.
- Revisions are read in one batch keyed by id, projected to the four fields the match and the result
  use. The previous shape issued one query per candidate entry; reading whole rows instead would make
  one anonymous request for a single result cost hundreds of megabytes, because a revision also
  carries `layout` and `fields` — half a megabyte each at what `saveEntry` allows.
- `countSearchPublished` returns the total behind the pages, plus `capped`, which says the scan
  window was full and the count should not be presented as a final total. The scan reads one row past
  the window, so a site with exactly that many entries is reported as complete rather than capped.
- A site that is not active has no public search, the same rule the sitemap follows.
- Pages under a reserved namespace are not offered, for the same reason the sitemap omits them: a
  module route answers that path first, so the result would not open.

### The index

`website.searchPublished` reads every published entry of a site, fetches each revision, and matches in
JavaScript. That is correct and it does not scale: the cost of one keystroke grows with the site, and
the window that bounds it is also a ceiling on what can be found.

`website_search` keeps a `SearchDocument` per published entry and a `SearchIndexState` per site.
`searchIndexed` answers from it, and the box calls that instead of scanning.

The index is **derived data**. It never decides what is public — the publication does — so it is built
under the same gate the reader and the sitemap apply, and a test asserts that everything it offers is
a page `getEntryByPath` will serve.

**Staleness is by publication.** `SearchIndexState.publicationId` records which set the index was
built for; when that is no longer the active one, the index is behind. A search that finds it behind
runs a few build passes itself and then answers with what it has, reporting `stale: true`. A visitor
is never blocked on a full rebuild, and the caller is never told a partial count is final.

**Rebuilds resume.** A pass reads a bounded batch ordered by path and records the last path it
handled, so `reindexSite` can be called repeatedly — by an operator, or by the search itself — without
starting again or indexing anything twice. A rebuild for a different publication clears first, because
leftovers describe pages that may no longer be served.

### The box renders its own results

The box used to submit to a hardcoded `/tim-kiem`. No module route serves that path and no page had to
exist there, so a visitor who searched landed on a 404 — the query layer was complete and unreachable.

It now submits nowhere and renders results in place. That is not a shortcut: the query lives in the
URL, and a page resolver is handed a path rather than a query string, so **no server-rendered surface
can see it**. A results page would need either a framework change to widen the resolver contract for
every deployment, or a theme template placing an island — which would make every website theme depend
on `website_search` for one optional section. Rendering next to the box costs neither.

The browser half calls `website.resolveSite`, `website.searchPublished` and
`website.countSearchPublished` — the same anonymous functions the sitemap and the public reader are
held to, so anything it offers is a page the reader will serve. It applies the same two-character
floor `searchPublished` applies, rather than spending a round trip to be told nothing, and it keeps
`?q=` in the URL so a search can be linked and reloaded.

### The three public views agree

The sitemap, the site's own search and `getEntryByPath` — the reader that actually serves a page —
apply the same publication gate: a published revision, not in trash, on an active site. Search and
the sitemap add the reserved-namespace rule, which `website` owns in `paths.ts` precisely so all
three read one definition rather than three copies that drift.

The invariant is that anything offered is openable. `getEntryByPath` previously had no active-site
check, so a caller naming a site being prepared could read it a page at a time while both listings
refused to name it; it now closes with them.

Search deliberately does **not** honour `noindex`. That is a crawler directive about a public index,
not a visibility rule: a page a visitor can open by URL is a page a visitor may find in the site's own
search box.

## Public forms and their schema version

A form's field contract is versioned. `Form.schemaVersion` is bumped whenever the fields change and
left alone when they do not, so fixing a typo in the success message does not invalidate every form
page a visitor currently has open. The comparison is over a canonical rendering of the schema, so
re-saving the same fields with the keys in a different order is recognised as the same contract.

`getForm` returns the version, the rendered page echoes it back on submit, and `submitForm` compares:

```ts
// File: examples/website/form-submit.ts
const form = await ctx.call('website_form.getForm', { id: 'contact' })
// ...render the page, carrying form.schemaVersion as a hidden input...
await ctx.call('website_form.submitForm', {
  formId: 'contact',
  payload: { email: 'mai@example.test' },
  schemaVersion: form.schemaVersion,
})
```

`listForms` reports the same version `getForm` does, so an admin surface seeding a version from the
list cannot emit an empty value that the route would read as "no version declared".

A mismatch is refused once, plainly, with `website_form.error.staleForm` and HTTP **409** — not 422.
Nothing is wrong with what the visitor typed; the form they typed it into moved, so the client should
reload rather than ask them to edit. Validating a stale payload against the current schema instead
would report a field the visitor was never shown as missing, and blame them for it. A refused stale
submission does not consume the visitor's rate budget.

Over HTTP the hidden input is named **`_schemaVersion`**, not `schemaVersion`. A form field name must
start with a letter, so a leading underscore is a name no form can declare. Reserving the bare name
would have made a form that *asks* a `schemaVersion` question answer 409 for ever: its answer stripped
from the payload and reparsed as a contract number.

Saves race on the version, because the version is the concurrency token. Two editors who both read
version 1 and both compute 2 would otherwise publish two different contracts under one number — and
the staleness check would then certify a stale payload as current, which is the very thing it exists
to prevent. The loser gets `website_form.error.saveConflict` and reloads.

The check is opt-in by the page: a client that sends no version keeps the previous behaviour. Either
way the accepted submission records `FormSubmission.schemaVersion`, so an operator reading an old
submission knows which contract its fields meant. Forms that existed before versioning read as
version 1.

### Consent belongs to the same contract

`FormSubmission.consent` is a boolean: on its own it records that somebody ticked a box, not which
text they agreed to. When the privacy notice changes, every earlier consent is silently reinterpreted
as agreement to the new wording.

So the notice lives on the form as `consentText` and is part of the **same** version as the fields.
Changing it advances `schemaVersion`, which means a page open against the old notice is refused with
`staleForm` exactly the way a page open against old fields is — agreement to a notice that has been
replaced is not agreement to its replacement. One version rather than two is the point: two could
disagree, and then no single number would say what a stored submission meant.

The accepted submission stores the notice **verbatim** in `FormSubmission.consentText`. A `Form` is
one mutable row with no history, so the version number alone could never be resolved back to the
older text once the notice is edited — and a consent record that cannot say what was consented to is
not a record.

Three rules follow, and they apply only to a form that actually shows a notice:

| Rule | Error |
| --- | --- |
| A submission must carry agreement. | `consentRequired` (422) |
| A submission must say which notice it saw. Stamping an unversioned post with the version in force would manufacture agreement to a notice the visitor may never have seen — so no version means no truthful record, and no write. | `consentVersionRequired` (409) |
| A save that omits `consentText` leaves the stored notice alone. A full replacement row meant any writer without that field — including the admin form editor, which has none — silently wiped the notice and disarmed the gate. An explicit `null` still clears it. | — |

A form with no notice is unaffected, including the lenient unversioned submit.

Over HTTP the consent box is read as agreement for `on`, `true`, `yes` or `1`. A checked
`<input type="checkbox" name="consent">` with no `value` attribute posts `on` — the HTML default —
so accepting only `true`/`1` told a visitor who had ticked the box that they must agree.

### A form is only as live as the site under it

`getForm` and `submitForm` used to check `Form.active` and stop there. Deactivating a **site** — the
way a whole website is withdrawn — reached its pages and left every form on it answering and
accepting posts. Both now resolve `website.Site` and refuse unless the site is active too, which is
the case the check exists for: the page is already sitting in a visitor's browser, the site is gone,
and the submit button still worked.

### A submission is personal data with a lifetime

Everything below is one idea: the answers a visitor types have an owner, a shortest useful audience,
and an end. What existed before was a table that only grew, readable in full by anyone who could
arrange the site's menu.

**Working the queue does not mean reading it.** `listSubmissions` no longer carries `payload`. It
carries when a submission arrived, what state it is in, whether it is held, and `summary` — the
answers the form itself declares safe to preview, in `Form.summaryFields`. That list is empty by
default, and empty is workable: a queue that shows arrival and status can be triaged without showing
what anyone wrote. `Form.summaryFields` is deliberately **not** part of `schemaVersion`: marking a
field previewable changes nothing a visitor sees, and versioning it would invalidate every open page
for an internal decision. It is also applied as it stands now rather than as it stood at collection
time — someone who realises today that a field holds personal data expects yesterday's rows covered
by that realisation, not exempt from it. Naming a field the schema does not declare is refused at
save rather than dropped, because an editor who mistypes a name and sees an empty column concludes
the feature is broken.

**Opening one record is a separate, recorded act.** `readSubmission` returns the answers, requires
site administration rather than structure management, and files a row in `FormSubmissionAudit`. A
caller below the bar gets the same answer as a caller naming a row that does not exist, so the
refusal never confirms the row. `countSubmissions` exists beside `listSubmissions` for the same
reason `countSearchPublished` does: the list's output is a projection of submission rows and a total
is not one of them.

**An export names its fields.** There is no "export everything". `exportSubmissions` takes an explicit
field list, checks it against the form's own schema, caps the result and reports `capped` rather than
presenting a truncated file as the whole set — and writes exactly that field list and row count into
the audit. An export is the one operation that puts personal data somewhere this system can no longer
reach, so what it took has to be answerable later without guessing. The columns
the export carries beside the answers are spelled `_id`, `_createdAt` and `_status` — a form field
name must start with a letter, so an underscore is a key no form can ask for, and a form with a
question named "status" cannot overwrite the row's real state with a visitor's answer. The submit
route reserves `_schemaVersion` for the same reason.

**Retention runs on its own.** `Form.retentionDays` is a window in days; absent means kept, which is
the honest default — a form nobody has given a period has not been thought about, and erasing on a
number this module invented would destroy records nobody agreed to lose. `website_form.retentionSweep`
is scheduled `every: '24h'` rather than `dailyAt`, because an age in days has no opinion about what
time it is anywhere and naming a wall clock would force a timezone into a decision that has none. It
runs `crossCompany`, reads which companies have forms with a window, and hands each its own
`purgeExpired` job keyed on the day. Passes are bounded: a form switched to ninety days after two
years of collecting has a very large first pass, and a sweep that runs for an hour is a sweep that
gets killed halfway and retried from the start for ever.

**Erasure keeps the row.** A purge writes `payload: {}`, clears `source` and `fingerprint`, sets
`status: 'purged'` and stamps `purgedAt`. It does not delete. Deleting would take the consent record
with it — the one thing that says this person was asked and agreed — and would free `dedupeKey`, so a
client replaying a months-old request would be accepted a second time as new. What the visitor is
owed is that their answers stop existing, not that the fact they wrote to us is forgotten. Each row
is erased under a compare-and-set on `purgedAt`, so the scheduled sweep and an administrator pressing
the button cannot both count the same row, and one audit row is filed per pass rather than per
submission — which rows went is written on the rows themselves.

**A hold is a reason, not a flag.** `holdSubmission` keeps a row past its date and records why, so the
row says who is relying on it; a hold with no reason is indistinguishable from one nobody remembers
setting. Held rows are excluded in the retention query rather than skipped in the loop — filtered
afterwards they would still fill the batch, and a form with five hundred held rows would make every
pass do nothing and report nothing left. Releasing a hold returns the row to the ordinary queue
rather than erasing it on the spot: releasing is not a request to delete.

`FormSubmissionAudit` is append-only and separate from the submission it describes, because the point
of the record is that it survives the erasure of what it describes. It stays in `website_form` rather
than borrowing `user.SecurityAudit`: this is a record about site content, and reaching for the
identity model would drag a dependency on `user` behind it.

### The permission catalogue had a blind spot

`website_form` shipped in the production deployment with **no permission declaration at all** —
five functions, eleven after this change — and the coverage test could not see it. The check read
`Object.entries(manifest.functions).filter(([, fn]) => coveredModules.has(fn.by))` — so a module
absent from the catalogue removed its own functions from the set being checked, and the assertion
passed on what was left. Twenty-one modules were in that gap.

The test now checks owners first, against a named `UNGOVERNED` list. `website_form` and
`website_menu` are declared and off it; the remaining nineteen are written down. The list may only
shrink: adding a name is how that test stops meaning anything, and a new module that forgets its
declaration now fails the same way a new function does.

## Half a feature is a trap

### assignTerm was a one-way door

`website.assignTerm` shipped with the taxonomy model and nothing else in the module could see or
undo what it did. There was no function that read an entry's terms, and none that removed one. So a
term put on a page went invisible the moment it was assigned — and `deleteTerm` refuses while an
assignment exists, which made the term itself permanent too. The only way out was raw SQL.

`listEntryTerms` and `unassignTerm` close it. `listEntryTerms` returns the assignment's own id
alongside the term, because that is the row a remove control has to name. `unassignTerm` answers
`ok` for a term that was not assigned: removing something that is already gone is the state the
caller asked for, and making a retry an error only punishes a double-submitted form.

The lesson is not about taxonomy. A write with no matching read is not a feature that is merely
incomplete — it is a feature that damages the data and hides the damage.

### The arguments no screen passed

A second audit, after the one that looked for functions nothing calls: for every `ctx.call` in
KetSuite, which of the callee's declared inputs does no caller ever supply? Most answers were paging
arguments a screen legitimately does not need. Three were not.

#### A guard against a stale base, never passed

`activatePublication` moves the site pointer under compare-and-set, which reads the current pointer
and then matches against what it just read — so the CAS cannot notice that the *list the row came
from* is stale. `expectedPublicationId` is the guard for exactly that, and nothing passed it.

The consequence: the publications screen draws a row prepared while nothing was live. Somebody else
activates a different set. Activating the first row now moves the site off theirs and supersedes it,
with no conflict reported to anyone. The screen sends the base it was drawn against now, and an empty
string means "nothing was live then" — a claim, not an absence, and a different thing from omitting
the argument.

The base is read with `activePublication` rather than found in the rows, because the state filter
added alongside it can hide the live row, and reading the base off a filtered list would claim the
site had nothing live and refuse every activation.

#### A preview link was minted by looking at the screen

The preview route minted a token on the GET. Opening the screen twice left two tokens; a link
prefetcher or a security scanner touching the link left one nobody knew about. `createPreviewToken`
has always taken `ttlSeconds` (60–3600, default 900) and `oneTime`, and neither was reachable, so
every link was fifteen minutes and reusable.

Minting is a POST now, with both terms on the form. Expiry is the cheaper control of the two — a link
that stops working on its own needs no revoking — and `oneTime` is what "send this to exactly one
reader" means. Both the entry-kind route and the kind-neutral `/admin/website/content/{id}/preview`
alias got the same treatment; the alias had the same defect.

#### Lists that could not be narrowed

`listSubmissions` and `countSubmissions` take `status`, `listPublications` takes `state`, and no
screen passed either. Superseded publications accumulate one per activation and are the majority of
the list within a week, which buries the two rows anybody came to see. Both filters are on their
screens now.

Still unpassed and deliberately left: `listSites.active` and `listForms.active`. The site list is
read through `sitesOf`, which every screen's site switcher shares, so filtering there needs a
separate call rather than a parameter — worth doing, not worth doing while touching six other screens.

### publishEntry had no inverse

A page could go live and never come back down. Nothing set `Entry.status` back, and nothing cleared
`publishedRevisionId` — which is precisely what the public resolver's per-entry fallback reads to
decide a page is live. A page published by mistake, an event that is over, a takedown request: the
only lever was `noindex`, which asks crawlers to forget the page while every visitor holding the
address reads on.

`unpublishEntry` clears `status`, `publishedRevisionId`, `scheduledRevisionId` and `publishAt`, and
keeps `publishedAt` — that field is the record of when the page was last live, and clearing it would
lose that to no purpose while doing nothing to take the page down.

It is also how a schedule is cancelled. `publishScheduled` re-reads `status` before it publishes, so
a scheduled page moved back to draft stays there and the queued job returns having done nothing.
Nothing has to reach into the queue and withdraw the job.

What it does not do is take a page out of an **active publication**. That set is frozen by design;
the way to change what it contains is to prepare and activate another one. The screen says so on the
control rather than leaving an editor to discover it.

### The schedule was in the contract and not on the screen

`publishEntry` has taken an optional `publishAt` since it was written: a time in the future moves the
entry to `scheduled` and enqueues `website.publishScheduled` with a unique key. No screen ever offered
the field, so a page could only go live at the moment somebody pressed the button. The publish control
is a form with a `datetime-local` field now — empty means now, which is what the contract's optional
argument has always meant.

### A list you cannot search is a list of the first thirty

`listEntries` and `countEntries` have both taken `search` and `status` since they were written, and no
screen passed either. With paging added, a site with three hundred pages could be read thirty at a
time in date order and no other way. Both filters are on the list now, in one GET form together with
the site switcher — three separate forms would each drop the other two's state on submit.

### A redirect could be created but never corrected

`saveRedirect` is an upsert and the screen minted a fresh id on every submit, so nothing could reach
the update branch. `Redirect` is unique on `(companyId, siteId, fromPath)`, which made the
consequence sharper than "you cannot edit": submitting the correction for a mistyped path hit the
unique index, and — because nothing checked it first — came back as a raw driver exception and a 500
rather than an answer. The typo kept the address, and the correct redirect could never be added.

Three things close it. `saveRedirect` looks for the path before writing and returns
`duplicateRedirect` the way `saveDomain` has always returned `duplicateHost`. The row carries an
edit control that posts to its own id. And the `active` flag, which the contract has always had and
the screen always wrote as `true`, is now a control — so the list's "active / inactive" column,
which until now could only ever read "active", says something.

Off rather than deleted, because the unique index holds one row per `fromPath`: deleting to free the
path and deactivating to stop it are the same reversible act, and one of them keeps the history of
what that address used to do. `listRedirects` has always taken an `active` filter; the screen passes
it now, which is what makes an inactive row findable.

### A host could be attached and never detached

The same shape on `saveDomain`: an upsert, a screen that always sent a new id, and a unique index on
the host. So a host attached to the wrong site, or a decommissioned one, stayed — and kept its claim
on that name, so nobody could attach it anywhere else either. Neither the primary nor
`redirectToPrimary` could be changed once set, even though `saveDomain` promotes a new primary and
demotes the old one in the same transaction.

`deleteDomain` refuses to remove the primary while the site still has other hosts. Canonical URLs
and the sitemap are built from the primary, so a site left with hosts and no primary publishes the
wrong address to every crawler that asks; promote another one first. The last host goes freely,
primary or not — a site with no domains is a site nobody has pointed anywhere yet.

### Reordering a menu was arithmetic

`MenuItem.position` is an integer and the only way to change it was to open the item's form and type
a different number. Moving the fourth link above the second meant working out what numbers the other
three would then need — which is not editing, and gets worse the longer the menu is.

`moveMenuItem` takes a direction. Two buttons per row, which are reachable from a keyboard without
anything having to be dragged; WEB-018 asked for keyboard reordering and this is the version that
needs no client-side code at all.

It **renumbers the sibling group** rather than swapping two positions. Nothing has ever enforced
distinct positions and `addMenuItem` defaults them all to zero, so a swap between two items that both
sit at zero would move nothing and look broken. Renumbering settles the order it found and then
applies the move, which also quietly repairs a menu whose positions had all collapsed.

Siblings only: moving an item past its parent's neighbour would be a reparent, which is a different
decision and already has its own field. And the ends are where a move stops, not where it fails — a
first item asked to go up answers `ok`, because that is the state the caller asked for.

### A question no screen could answer

Every Website screen is scoped to one site, because every contract behind them takes a `siteId`.
That is right for doing the work and wrong for noticing it: "is anything wrong" could only be
answered by opening each site in turn and remembering what the last one said.

And the things worth knowing are exactly the ones nobody goes looking for. A site with no primary
domain publishes the wrong canonical to every crawler that asks — and there is no screen you would
have opened to find that out, because you had no reason to suspect it. A publication prepared last
week and never activated looks like nothing at all. An index that has not caught up degrades search
quietly, by design.

The overview reads what already existed — `listDomains`, `listPublications`, `indexStatus`, one
round per site — and lists only the sites with something to say, each row leading to the screen that
fixes it. Two decisions about what *not* to warn about:

- **An index that never existed is not an index that fell behind.** A site nobody has searched has no
  index and needs none; `state: 'absent'` raises nothing.
- **No host at all outranks the wrong host.** A site nothing points at answers nowhere, which is not
  a canonical-URL problem, and stacking both messages would bury the one that matters.

The number of sites read is on the screen whether or not anything is wrong, because a list that only
ever holds problems cannot tell "nothing is wrong" from "nothing was checked".

### Hosting extensions

Hosting operators may provide `StudioDomainPolicy.siteCreating` to reserve an address before a
new Studio site is persisted. A refusal leaves no site behind. `siteCreated` runs after the
canonical site writer succeeds and can attach the reserved address. Operators must preserve
existing assigned domains on retries and check ownership in their shared registry; the CMS does
not choose an operator's hostname or DNS configuration.

### Twelve readers, no writer

The home entry at `/` is required site content. `trashEntry` refuses it with
`website.error.homeCannotTrash`, and `saveEntry` refuses moving its path with
`website.error.homePathRequired`. Editors can still change its content and publication state.
Other pages retain the ordinary trash/restore behavior. Protecting the path at the domain boundary
also prevents a client from moving the home first and then deleting it.

`Entry.status === 'trash'` is honoured in twelve places across five modules. The public resolver
refuses a trashed entry. The sitemap leaves it out. The menu link validator does not count it as a
target. The search index skips it. Preflight does not check it. The media library does not count it
as a use. `preparePublication` refuses a set that names one, with its own error message.

**Nothing ever wrote it.** Every consumer of the concept was built, in five modules, and the producer
did not exist — so a page created by mistake stayed on the list for ever, and the only thing an
editor could do was give it a title that said to ignore it.

`trashEntry` and `untrashEntry` are that producer. Trash rather than delete, and that is the whole
design rather than a compromise: `ref:` emits no foreign key, so removing an entry would leave its
revisions, its term assignments, its preview tokens and — across a module boundary `website` cannot
reach — its `website_seo.EntrySeo` row all pointing at nothing. Trash keeps every row and answers the
question people actually have, which is "get this off my list". The eleven readers were right; they
were just waiting.

Two details. Trashing clears `publishedRevisionId` the way `unpublishEntry` does — the resolver
checks the status as well, but a pointer left behind is a pointer somebody later trusts. And taking
something back makes a **draft**, never a published page: what it used to say may be the reason it
was thrown away.

`listEntries` and `countEntries` now leave the bin out unless `status: 'trash'` is asked for by
name. They were the last two readers that did not, because until now there was nothing to exclude —
and the two have to agree, or the pager counts rows the list will not show and the last page comes
back empty.

### An image could be deleted out from under the pages drawing it

`deleteTerm` has refused a term that is in use since it was written. `deleteMediaMetadata` removed
its row with no question asked — so an image could vanish from under every page placing it, and those
pages went on naming an id that no longer resolved. Nothing anywhere said why the picture stopped
appearing.

The reason it stayed open this long is that a layout had no way to *say* a setting was a media
reference: `website.hero.image` was `text?`, indistinguishable from a URL or a caption, so a usage
scan would have been a guess about which strings look like ids.

It did not need a new mechanism. Section settings are parsed by the same type parser as model fields,
and that parser already understands `ref:module.Model` — `ref` maps to `string` in the settings
validator, so `image: 'ref:website.MediaMetadata?'` is machine-readable *and* changes nothing about
what is already stored. `mediaFieldsOf` reads the composed manifest for the settings declared that
way, so a theme that never declares one is simply never scanned, and a theme that declares three is
scanned for three.

`mediaUsage` names the pages; `deleteMediaMetadata` refuses while any remain; the media screen shows
the list, so the refusal is one an editor can act on rather than argue with. A draft counts as much
as a published page — taking the image away breaks what an editor is working on just as surely as
what a visitor reads.

**A capped scan refuses too.** The scan reads up to `USAGE_SCAN_LIMIT` entries, and on a site past
that it cannot answer "nothing uses this". So it does not: the delete is refused with a different
message, and the screen says the scan did not reach the whole site rather than showing an empty list
that reads as "safe". This is the same rule the publication preflight follows, for the same reason —
a partial check presented as a clean bill of health is worse than no check.

### What you see and what you get

The submissions list filters by status. The export ignored it. So narrowing the screen to the four
rows you meant and pressing Export handed you every row the form has ever taken — silently, in a file
named the same either way. The export carries the filter now, says so on the form when one is
applied, and names the file for what it holds.

Two more `active` filters that the contracts always accepted and no screen passed: on the sites list
and on the forms list. A suspended site and a retired form were indistinguishable from a live one in
the only place anybody looks. The sites list reads `listSites` directly rather than through
`sitesOf` — that helper feeds every screen's site switcher, and a switcher that hid suspended sites
would make them unreachable rather than merely unlisted.

`preflightPublication` takes `entryIds` and nothing passed it, so the only question the screen could
ask was "every page on the site" — which is the one that hits the scan ceiling and can then only
answer "ask again by id". The screen offers the published set as well: a named set is never a partial
scan, so that question has a definite answer however large the site is.

### A field that was stored, returned, and dropped

`Site.tokens` could be written, `resolveSite` answered with it, and the storefront threw it away: the
scope it builds for the theme is `{ id, title, theme }`. So the column existed, the contract accepted
it, and no page ever looked different for it. Two sites on one theme were the same site in two
colours of nothing.

The mechanism was already there and already published. `tokensToCss` writes `--ket-*` custom
properties into a cascade layer, and the declared order is `ket.reset < ket.theme < ket.app <
ket.user`. A site's overrides go into `ket.app`, which already beats the theme's own `ket.theme` —
so a site that sets nothing renders exactly as before, and a site that sets one colour changes one
colour rather than forking the theme.

The tokens stylesheet is already a per-request route, so it is the natural place: it resolves the
site alongside the theme and appends the site's layer.

#### A person's typing, in a stylesheet on every page

This is the part that needed care. Theme tokens are written by whoever wrote the theme; site tokens
are typed into an admin form. `tokensToCss` sanitised the *name* into a custom property and passed
the **value** through untouched — which was fine while nothing untrusted reached it, and is not fine
now. A value of `#0a7 } :root { display: none` closes the declaration, closes the rule, and hands the
rest of the document to whoever typed it.

`partitionTokens` answers with the pairs that are safe to render and the names of those that are not,
and the two sides of the boundary use it differently on purpose:

- **`saveSite` refuses.** A value that cannot be rendered is not stored, so the question never
  reaches the reader.
- **The stylesheet drops.** A row that predates the check, or arrives another way, degrades the
  branding rather than serving a broken stylesheet or a blank page.

An empty tokens box means "no overrides", not "keep what is stored" — this is the only screen that
writes them, so a blank field is a decision. Malformed JSON goes down to the contract as the string
it is, and comes back as `invalidTokens`: sending `{}` instead would erase a site's branding because
somebody mistyped a brace.

`Site.siteGroup` is the other half of this finding and is **not** fixed here: it is written by the
contract and read by nothing at all. Removing a column is a migration, and it may yet be what a
deployment groups sites by; it is written down here so the next person does not have to rediscover
it.

### The index that was still a scan

`SearchDocument` exists so "a search is a lookup rather than a scan", and `haystack` — title and
excerpt, lowercased into one column — exists so "a match is one comparison". Both are quotes from the
model's own comments, and the read path did neither:

```ts
// File: packages/ketsuite/src/modules/website_search/functions.ts
const rows = await ctx.db.all(from(Document).where(eq(Document.siteId, args.siteId)))
const matches = rows.filter((row) => String(row.haystack).includes(needle))
```

Every document of the site, into memory, on every keystroke, filtered in JavaScript. The index had
made the *write* side cheap — one row per entry, no revision fetch per match — and left the read side
exactly what it replaced. The match is a `LIKE` on `haystack` now, with the window in the query and
the total from `count`, so a page of ten hits reads ten rows.

#### A wildcard a visitor typed

`like` could not escape a pattern and `ilike` could, so every case-sensitive search in the codebase
passed whatever a person typed straight into a `LIKE`. A `%` matched the whole table and a `_`
matched any character — someone searching for "50%" or "co_op" got nonsense, and the count beside it
agreed, which made it look deliberate.

`like` takes the same `escapePattern` flag now, and `likeLiteral` turns what a person typed into a
literal. Both halves are needed: the backslash is only special when the statement says `ESCAPE`. The
entry-title search on the pages list uses it too — that box was only exposed to people recently, and
it had the same hole.

#### An index nobody rebuilt on a schedule

`reindexSite` says in its own comment that it exists "so an operator or a job can drive a long
rebuild". There was no job. Between publications the index caught up only through `searchIndexed`,
which builds three passes inline and then answers `stale` — a sound fallback that was also the entire
schedule, paid for by whichever visitors happened to search first.

`indexSweep` runs hourly across companies and queues `rebuildStale` per legal entity; that job spends
a bounded number of passes and re-queues itself if a site is still behind, so a first build over a
large site cannot hold a worker slot long enough to be killed and retried from the beginning. The
company is in the unique key because a unique job key is unique per tenant, not per company.

The passes moved to `rebuild.ts` because a job cannot reach a declared function — a `JobContext` has
no `call` — so building has to be an ordinary import, the way `website_form` keeps its purge. The
split says what the model says: the index is derived, and building it is not the same act as
answering with it.

### A preview link that opened nothing

`previewEntry` has existed since preview tokens did, and **nothing ever called it**. A link could be
minted, shown on screen, copied into a chat, expired and revoked — and opening it reached no route at
all. The whole feature ended at handing over a string.

The renderer is the framework's, because only the framework can draw a theme region: `serve.pages`
gains `previewResolve`, a function taking `{ token }`, beside the `resolve` that takes a path. A
request to the preview path with a token resolves through that function instead, and the same
`pageScope` builds the same scope for the same theme — which is the point. A second shape would have
meant a second renderer, and a preview drawn by a different renderer is not a preview.

That is why `previewEntry` now answers what `getEntryByPath` answers rather than `{ entry, revision }`.
Its `meta` is the entry's own rather than the publication's frozen copy: a preview exists to show what
is about to go out.

`page.path` comes from the row, not the request. A preview is served from one address and is a page
at another, and the theme writes canonical links from that field.

#### Three headers, and why each

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `cache-control` | `no-store, max-age=0` |
| `x-robots-tag` | `noindex, nofollow, noarchive` |
| `referrer-policy` | `no-referrer` |

`no-store` rather than `private`, because the reader's own browser cache is a place the draft outlives
the link. `no-referrer` because the token is in the URL, and without it the first outbound click hands
it to a third party. They are set only on the preview path — a published page is meant to be indexed
and cached, and a test asserts it carries none of them.

#### The path is one no page can claim

`/_ket/preview`, inside the namespace the framework already owns for `/_ket/health` and `/_ket/agent`.
`reservedPrefixes` derives from module routes, and the framework's own routes are not module routes —
so `/_ket` was **not** reserved, and a page published at `/_ket/health` would have been advertised in
the sitemap while the framework served the path. It is in `ALWAYS_RESERVED` now, beside `/api` and
`/internal/v1`. A deployment that sets `previewPath` outside `/_ket/` is refused at boot rather than
serving a path a page could take.

### Preview links accumulate

Every visit to an entry's preview screen mints another token. That is deliberate: a preview is
cheap and short-lived. But the links are pasted into chats and tickets, where they outlive the
reason they were shared, and `revokePreviewTokens` — which could always call all of them back —
had no caller. The preview screen now offers it, and lands back on the entry afterwards rather
than on the preview screen, which would immediately mint a fresh one.

### A GET must not change anything

Four routes added while building these screens changed state on a GET: activating a publication,
rolling one back, removing a site member, and restoring a revision. Each was reached by an ordinary
link, so a link prefetcher, a security scanner, or "open all in tabs" was enough to push content
live or drop somebody's access. All four are POST controls now and all four routes answer 405 to
anything else, which is what the three older delete routes in the same file already did.

The test that holds this drives the routes with a real request rather than asserting they are
composed. Removing one guard fails it; asserting composition would not have noticed.

### A list has to say how much it is not showing

Entries and submissions use their domain count and page APIs; the shared command bar shows
that pager once. Revisions, taxonomy terms, media, redirects and publications read every metadata
batch before `prepareCollectionTable` applies native URL search and pagination. A 100-row API
batch is a transport limit, never the reported total. The complete revision choices and the
selected redirect remain available even when the table shows another page.

The metadata readers use a stable identifier to break ordering ties. Publications accept an
optional offset and enforce site membership, matching the other Website readers. Revision and
publication lists select only their declared metadata rather than loading layout or publication
snapshots. This preserves the existing screens and API grants, at the cost of reading O(N)
metadata for a collection request; exceptionally large collections may need dedicated filtered
count APIs later. There is no arbitrary total cap or truncated result presented as complete.

### Where a shared route sends the browser back to

Three routes hang off an entry without caring whether it is a page or a post — the head tags, and
now the two term routes. Each of them redirected to `/admin/website/pages/{id}`, which answers 404
for a post, because that route refuses an entry of the other type. `entryHref` reads the entry and
picks the right one.

## A layout has identity

### Where the builder document lives, and why it is not a new table

The page builder design asks for a versioned document with stable node identity before anything else
is built, and asks that the model be reconciled against what exists rather than stood up beside it.
The reconciliation says: **the document is `EntryRevision.layout`, and no new table is needed.**

| What the builder needs | What already provides it |
| --- | --- |
| Immutable revisions | `EntryRevision` is one row per version, never updated |
| Optimistic concurrency | `saveEntry` takes `expectedRevisionId` and races the entry pointer |
| A frozen set at publish | `Publication.entries` freezes `{entryId, revisionId, path, meta}` |
| Content the theme renders | `pageScope.sections` is the layout, passed through untouched |

A parallel `BuilderDocument` table would need its own versioning, its own publication freeze, and its
own reconciliation with `Entry.status` and the preview token — three duplications of machinery that
already works, and three more places for the two to disagree about which content is live.

What was missing was never storage. It was **identity**.

### A placement that can be recognised again

A layout was an ordered array and nothing else. Save a page with the sections swapped, and the stored
revision cannot say whether a section moved or was deleted and a different one added in its place.
Nothing downstream can recover that from position: not undo, not a diff between two revisions, not a
conflict that explains itself. All three are in the builder design, and all three were unbuildable.

Every placement now carries an `id`, beside `type` rather than inside `settings` - it is not something
a section declares or a theme renders, and putting it in `settings` would collide with a real setting
and fail validation.

`saveEntry` assigns ids rather than trusting them, so content written before identity existed gains it
on its first save. An id that is already there is never replaced: identity belongs to the client
across an editing session, and rewriting it server-side would break the undo stack it anchors. The
same happens on `restoreRevision`, because a restore is a write like any other - putting an
unidentifiable layout back at the head would make every diff after it read as a rewrite.

**Derived from content, not from position.** Two placements of the same type with the same settings are
disambiguated by how many identical ones came before. Deriving from the index instead would mean the
first save after a reorder - exactly the save that turns legacy content into identified content -
renamed everything it touched, which is the one case the id exists to distinguish.

Two ids are refused at the write rather than resolved at the read: a malformed one, and the same one
used twice. A duplicate makes every later diff ambiguous, and there is no honest way to guess which
of the two a change belongs to.

### A diff, and a conflict that carries one

`website.diffRevisions` compares two revisions of one page and answers per placement: `added`,
`removed`, `moved` (with where it came from), `settings` (naming the fields), and `retyped`. Retyped
is separate because a placement whose type changed is a different section wearing the same id, and a
reviewer must never read that as an edit. Both revisions must belong to the entry the caller was
authorized against, so a revision id cannot become a way to read another page's history.

`identified` says whether the comparison had identity to work with. Placements written before this
change have no id and compare as removed plus added - the truthful answer, since without an id there
is no evidence the two are the same section, and guessing by position is the thing being replaced. A
client can use the flag to explain that rather than present it as a real rewrite.

A failed `expectedRevisionId` check used to answer "someone else saved this", which leaves the editor
to reload and find the difference by eye. The refusal now carries the diff between the revision the
caller was editing and the one at the head. The report is best effort and attached to a refusal that
already stands on its own: a revision that cannot be read produces a refusal with no report, never an
error in place of the refusal.

### A section can hold sections

A layout was a flat ordered list, so a page could place a hero and a paragraph but could never put two
things side by side. Every mock in the builder design shows nested structure, and there was nothing to
render it from.

A placement may now carry `slots`, keyed by the slot names its section declares:

```jsonc
// File: examples/website/nested-layout.json
{
  "type": "website.columns",
  "settings": { "gap": "wide" },
  "slots": {
    "left": [{ "type": "website.rich_text", "settings": { "body": "..." } }],
    "right": [{ "type": "website.hero", "settings": { "heading": "..." } }]
  }
}
```

**Named slots rather than one child list**, because a two-column section has two places to put things
and the page has to say which. A section that declares no slots holds nothing, which leaves every
section written before this exactly as closed as it was.

`SectionDef.slots` is the declaration:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `accepts` | Section types this slot takes. Absent means any composed section - the honest default for a plain container, since the alternative is every container listing the whole catalogue and going stale as it grows. |
| `max` | How many children fit. |

`website.columns` is the first one: `left` and `right`, capped at twenty each. Both are capped because
a slot with no ceiling is a way to put a whole page inside one container and walk past the limit on
the page.

**What the write refuses**, all as a list rather than an exception, and each with a `path` like
`0.left.2` so an editor can focus the node: a slot the section never declared (silently dropping the
children would lose an author's work between the save and the render), a type the slot does not
accept, a slot over its `max`, a tree deeper than six levels, and an unknown section type - which is
now caught inside a slot exactly as it always was at the top.

**The page limit counts the tree.** The old ceiling was a hundred *top-level* placements, which after
nesting would have bounded nothing: a hundred containers each holding a hundred children would have
passed a check written to bound a page. It is now a hundred nodes anywhere in the document.

### Drawing the children

`{% slot "left" %}` inside a section's template renders what the placement put in that slot. It goes
through the same path as `{% sections %}`, so a nested section is rendered by the same template and
checked against the same manifest as a top-level one, and an unknown type raises in both places.

The renderer tracks the open placement on a stack rather than passing children through the scope.
Children are already-rendered markup, and a scope carries values a template may print: putting markup
where `{{ }}` can reach it would either escape it into visible tag soup or open a hole, and reserving
a scope name would collide with a section that wanted that name. Rendering is synchronous, so a stack
is exact.

An empty slot renders nothing rather than raising. A container with an empty column is an ordinary
state of a page being built, not a fault; a slot the section never declared is caught at the write,
which is where an author can still do something about it. `{% slot %}` is refused in report mode, the
same way `{% sections %}` is - a printed report has no page tree to draw children from.

### Identity and diffs go all the way down

`withPlacementIds` walks the tree, so a child gets an id the same way a top-level section does, and
uniqueness is checked across the whole document rather than per level - a diff keyed on id has no
level to disambiguate with. A container's derived id folds in its children's ids, so two containers
holding different things are different containers even when their own settings match.

`diffPlacements` walks the tree too. This matters more than it sounds: comparing only the top level
would have folded a subtree edit into "the container's settings are unchanged" and reported nothing at
all. A change six levels down is now reported on the node that changed.

Every change carries a `path`, and `moved` carries the path it came from. That is what makes dragging
a section from one column to the other read as **one move** rather than as a removal in one place and
an arrival in another.

## The storefront page scope

`packages/ketjs/src/server/boot.ts` builds the scope a theme renders a public page against: `site`,
`locale`, `page`, `meta` and `sections`. Joint fills and island props are projected from that scope,
so anything a module wants on a public page has to be in it.

`meta` used to be hardcoded to `{}`, which silently disabled the head tags. It now passes through
whatever the page resolver returns. The framework does not name the fields — the module that owns
them decides what is public — so this closed the SEO half without teaching `boot.ts` about
`website_seo`.

The search box still shows its fallback label, because `label` is a prop and props are projected from
that scope. That is cosmetic; the box itself now works (see below).

## Testing

```bash
# Run from: repository root
npm run build --silent && node --test .build/test/website-seo.test.js
```

`test/website-seo.test.ts` covers the projection rules as pure functions and the write path against a
SQLite adapter, including cross-site isolation and the refusal of a foreign canonical.


## Studio draft images

Studio uploads entry images through `POST /website/images/{entryId}/{image|cover}?site={siteId}`.
The route requires the ERP editing grant and active company, decodes raster data before storing it,
and uses the deployment Object Storage provider. `website.ImageAsset` records a private 24-hour lease
before bytes are written; the upload response contains an authorized `/website/files/{id}` URL.
Only the uploading actor can read an unclaimed image. A saved draft is readable by authorized Studio
readers; anonymous access requires a reference in the published entry of an active site.

`website.saveEntry` and `website.restoreRevision` claim image references inside their revision
transaction. Failed validation or stale revisions leave uploads pending. Historical revisions and
publication snapshots retain their references, so removing an image from the latest body does not
break history. Collection never relies on a browser unload request.

Enable workers: `website.collectImages` runs every minute and retries Object Storage removal failures.
Unreferenced attached objects have a separate 24-hour grace. Completed abandoned uploads lose bytes
before metadata; unfinished uploads retain deletion tombstones to collect late writes. Tombstone
metadata retention must be configured before a long-lived deployment. Generic `/files` attachment
semantics remain unchanged, and taxonomy ownership is not covered by this entry-only bridge.


## Studio site appearance

`website.saveStudioStyle` updates the site's live appearance using `expectedRevisionId` and an atomic
compare-and-set on `Site.styleRevision`. Accepted values are title, preset, accent, font, spacing,
buttons, account, logo and footer. This does not create a page revision or publish content. Studio's
frame, authenticated preview and public delivery read `Site.studioStyle`. Existing publication and
scheduled appearance snapshots remain stored for history; live site appearance takes precedence when
rendering. Page rollback and scheduled publication change content, not current site style.

The function belongs to `website.configure` with the `website.configuration-audit` policy marker.
The managed `website.designer` role includes author and configure capabilities, not publishing.
It is available for explicit assignment through ERP administration; existing users are not upgraded.


The trusted `pages.render` deployment callback can present resolved public content without executing
uploaded theme code. Studio uses the same pure block renderer and theme CSS as its builder, and the
canonical LiveDoc serializer for server-rendered posts. Native `website_menu.publicMenu` supplies the
header; the Studio menu authoring adapter is still pending. An entry without a style snapshot, or with
unsupported industry sections, falls back to the configured KTL theme for the whole page. Blog/search
and pixel parity are not yet verified.

`websiteAnonymousScope` resolves an exact configured hostname inside the selected tenant database.
Multiple matching companies fail closed; an unknown domain delegates to existing anonymous scope
handling. Private fleet composition preserves this result before applying its tenant fallback.

### Site-level Google Tag Manager

Settings → general information exposes the optional `googleTagManagerId` field. A blank value
disables tracking. `website.saveSite` validates container identifiers; omitted values preserve the
existing configuration and an empty value clears it. The Studio resource preserves its revision
check and site administration permission. Save takes effect on published pages immediately.

The same-origin `/_ket/asset/website_backend/gtm.mjs` loader keeps queued data-layer events, adds
one asynchronous Google script and records readiness on the document root. It never loads in
preview or a staff session. Its source lives in the public website-client package and is copied by
the normal build, independently of company theme packages.

An enabled visitor page adds Google script/connect/frame origins to its content security policy.
Custom JavaScript variables in existing containers require `unsafe-eval`; inline scripts remain
disallowed. Sites without a container and staff/preview pages keep their existing strict policy.
See [Google's CSP guidance](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/csp).
A loaded container does not prove that a conversion trigger matched or that Ads received an event.
