title: Security and data scope
description: Preserve KetSuite staff, customer, permission, effect, company, and branch boundaries.
---

KetSuite has two distinct identity planes. Staff sessions authorize backend functions and company or
branch context. Customer sessions and tokens authorize Channel API capabilities within a customer realm.
Do not share credentials, cookies, or generic function transports between those planes.

## Staff request boundary

On each authenticated request, KetSuite rebuilds the user's session context from live rows. The cookie
contains the last selection, not authoritative company or branch membership. Revoking a grant or
archiving a company therefore takes effect on the next request across every process.

The app resolves function permissions through the same live resolver exposed by `user.permitted` and
`user.effectiveAccess`:

- a live, unexpired superuser receives the unrestricted marker;
- another staff user receives exact qualified function names from applicable tenant/company/branch assignments;
- managed templates are accepted only when their version and digest match the composed deployment;
- the explanation projection carries role, source, scope, bundle path, risk, and repair issues;
- `ctx.call()` applies that permission set together with declared effects and scope.

Zitadel and other IdPs authenticate a subject. They do not choose a KetSuite company, branch, role, bundle,
or function permission. Those decisions come only from local live authorization rows and the immutable
deployment catalog.

Never treat a hidden menu or missing button as authorization. Routes must call an authorized function,
and functions must declare effects for every resource they touch.

## Company and branch isolation

The request context carries the active `company` and `branch` plus the sets the user may access. KetJS
applies model scope to reads and writes:

| Model scope | KetSuite meaning | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shared` | Visible across companies within the tenant | Partner identity, company directory, security metadata |
| `company` | Restricted to the active company | Commercial terms, orders, accounting records |
| `branch` | Restricted to the active operating branch | Branch-local operational records |

Do not trust a `companyId` or `branchId` received from a form as authority to switch context. Context
changes go through user functions that validate active grants. Do not use unchecked SQL or a shared
adapter to bypass scoped tables in application code.

Test both directions of isolation: a permitted row is visible in its context, and the same identifier is
not visible or writable from an ungranted company or branch.

## Function exposure and effects

`defineFn()` is the security declaration for domain operations:

- `input` and `output` constrain transport data;
- `effects` constrain resources the handler may access;
- default exposure is the normal permission-controlled function surface;
- `exposure: 'internal'` keeps infrastructure operations off the public function transport;
- `agent: true` is a deliberate capability publication, not a harmless metadata flag;
- `idempotent: true` promises safe replay behavior and must match the implementation.

Prefer `ctx.call()` from a route. Every use of `ctx.callUnchecked()` needs a visible trust argument: the
Channel API uses it behind its own authentication, CSRF, realm, capability, and contract checks; staff
backend routes do not need that bypass.

Use `permissionInventory(manifest)` or `ket permissions --json` for machine-readable authorization review.
The report includes every composed module, even one with no functions, and records whether each function is
HTTP/internal, anonymous, provision-only, cross-company, replay-safe, agent-published, and projected. It is a
composition report, not a grant: only live KetSuite Role/Grant/Assignment rows decide what a staff user may call.

The implemented [permission bundles and scoped roles RFC](/architecture/permission-bundles-rfc/) defines how an
application classifies that exact inventory, composes versioned templates, and assigns roles by scope. Enable
`permissions.requireCoverage` at the deployment boundary to fail composition when any function or module
posture is missing. A new function never inherits access from its name or from an existing manager-style role.

Capability grants do not replace record-specific policy. Domain functions call `enforcePolicy()` with a stable
qualified policy key after capability authorization and before the sensitive transition. A denial uses a stable
code and emits only sanitized evidence. This keeps maker-checker, ownership, lifecycle, and threshold rules with
the domain that owns the record without forking the user resolver.

Neither capabilities nor policies decide *which records a caller may see*. A module whose records are private to
an audience resolves that audience from its own rows, in one place, and every read of those records passes
through it: `crm.caseAudience` for cases, `flow.visibleProjects` for projects. Both answer `null` for "no
restriction" — no actor, a superuser, or an explicit company-wide grant row — and a list of ids otherwise, so a
caller who belongs to nothing reads nothing. The company-wide grant is a row rather than a capability on purpose:
`Ctx` carries no allow-list, so a domain function cannot ask what the caller may do, and an audience that could
be widened from the permission catalogue would be widened by accident.

An anonymous provider callback that owns a cryptographic company binding may use
`ctx.callUncheckedForVerifiedCompany()` after signature verification. Derive the company from signed
credential material and verify the exact request bytes before dispatch. The helper deliberately creates one
company scope inside the already selected tenant; an unsigned URL, header, query, or decoded payload field is
never enough authority to select that company.

## Customer Channel API

`channel_api` owns and reserves `/api/customer/v1/`, `/api/staff/v1/`, `/api/pos/v1/`,
`/api/integration/v1/`, and `/internal/v1/`. A contributor publishes inside a reserved prefix only
through the owner's route contract and a compatible dependency.

Customer browser sessions use an HTTP-only, `SameSite=Lax` cookie scoped to the customer API path.
Mutations validate same-origin and CSRF data. Native clients use Bearer access tokens and rotating
refresh tokens; stored values are digests. Realm resolution comes from the website host or the explicit
channel realm header, not from staff company context.

See [Channel API architecture](/ketsuite/channel-api/) for route construction and the generated
[Customer API reference](/ketsuite/channel-api-reference/) for the current external contract.

## Transactions and concurrency

Use `ctx.tx()` when a business invariant spans more than one write. Put uniqueness that must survive
concurrent requests in model indexes, then handle the losing writer deterministically. Application-only
"check then insert" logic is not a concurrency guarantee.

Idempotent mutations should accept stable identifiers or use KetJS idempotency namespaces at the
external boundary. The Channel API requires `Idempotency-Key` for operations whose route contract marks
them idempotent and rejects reuse with a different body.

Warehouse completion treats the picking state as the concurrency fence: the final transition to `done`
uses compare-and-set, and any generated backorder is committed in the same transaction as the stock
ledger changes. Staff execution must also validate each submitted quantity against the move demand and
each return against a delivered move line; a preview version alone does not authorize arbitrary line
content.

## Review checklist

- Which identity plane calls this code: staff, customer, anonymous, worker, or internal service?
- Does the machine-readable permission inventory classify every composed module and callable function?
- Which company, branch, tenant, site, or realm selects the data?
- Are all resources present in `effects`, including reads used only for validation?
- Does the route use `ctx.call()` unless it owns an explicit replacement authorization boundary?
- Can two concurrent requests violate an invariant?
- Are secrets, tokens, and passwords absent from logs, URLs, screenshots, and committed fixtures?
- Do denial and cross-scope tests accompany the successful path?
