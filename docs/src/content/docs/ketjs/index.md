title: KetJS framework
description: A complete guide to building modular full-stack applications with KetJS.
---

KetJS is a zero-required-dependency full-stack framework for Node.js. It composes models, server
functions, routes, jobs, themes, and agent capabilities into one checked manifest. KetSuite is built
on this framework, but every KetJS primitive can also be used to build an independent application.

:::caution[Development status]
KetJS is currently in the `0.1.x` preview line and has not reached a stable release. APIs, data formats, CLI
behavior, and deployment assumptions may change without notice. Do not treat the current version as
production-ready.
:::

## Install

Create a new SQLite-backed application directly from npm:

```bash
# Run from: /path/to/projects
npx -y @ketvietlab/ketjs@latest new my_app --dir ./my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

For an existing project, install the framework with `npm install @ketvietlab/ketjs`. Add
`@ketvietlab/ketjs-postgres` and its `postgres` peer only when the application uses PostgreSQL.

## Design goals

KetJS is organized around six constraints:

1. **Explicit composition.** A module extends only contracts published by a dependency. There is no
   import-time registration or arbitrary monkey-patching.
2. **One artifact.** The composed manifest is the module graph, schema source, function inventory,
   theme contract, and agent descriptor.
3. **Declared effects.** A function or job can access only the models, queues, storage, and transports
   named in its effects.
4. **Safe presentation.** First-party UI uses `@ketvietlab/ketjs-view`; third-party themes use restricted KTL and
   cannot execute JavaScript.
5. **Operational durability.** Migrations, idempotency, queues, streams, storage, and multitenancy are
   framework contracts rather than application conventions.
6. **Business-owned documents.** A module declares its printable data contract and default template;
   the framework provides safe compilation and deterministic PDF rendering without creating a parallel
   report module for every domain.

## Packages

| Package | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `@ketvietlab/ketjs` | Modules, workspaces, data, functions, HTTP, jobs, storage, sessions, and composition. |
| `@ketvietlab/ketjs/pdf` | Constrained report markup, HTML preview, Inter font assets, and deterministic PDF rendering. |
| `@ketvietlab/ketjs/theme` | KTL compilation, theme runtime helpers, view models, and design tokens. |
| `@ketvietlab/ketjs/testing` | Isolated headless end-to-end applications and an HTTP test client. |
| `@ketvietlab/ketjs-view` | Browser-safe signals, HTML templates, SSR, hydration, JSX, and islands. |
| `@ketvietlab/ketjs-view-tools` | File-based static pages, asset bundling, live development, preview, and validation. |
| `@ketvietlab/create-view` | A runnable static Ket view project scaffold. |
| `@ketvietlab/ketjs-postgres` | The optional PostgreSQL adapter. SQLite remains the built-in default. |

`@ketvietlab/ketjs` depends only on `@ketvietlab/ketjs-view`. The core package has no required database driver or service SDK.

## How an application is assembled

```mermaid

  roots["Module roots and imports"] --> workspace["Workspace declaration"]
  workspace --> app["Resolved DeploymentSpec"]
  app --> manifest["Composed Manifest"]
  manifest --> schema["Model schema"]
  manifest --> operations["Functions and jobs"]
  manifest --> presentation["Routes, menus, themes, islands, and reports"]
  manifest --> capabilities["Agent capability descriptor"]
  schema --> migrations["Migration plan"]
  migrations --> runtime["Live runtime"]
  operations --> runtime
  presentation --> runtime
  capabilities --> runtime
  runtime --> pdf["Deterministic PDF artifacts"]
```

The deployment decides its complete module composition. Every database and tenant running that
deployment receives the same behavior and schema.

## Read the framework in dependency order

The guides are organized by what depends on what. A new contributor should follow this sequence;
an experienced contributor can enter at the stage that owns the change.

1. **Compose the deployment.** Start with [Quick start](/ketjs/quick-start/), then learn
   [Workspaces and deployments](/ketjs/workspaces/), [Modules and manifest](/ketjs/modules/), and
   [Module discovery](/ketjs/module-discovery/).
2. **Model data and behavior.** Read [Models and scopes](/ketjs/models/),
   [Queries and changesets](/ketjs/data/), [Functions and effects](/ketjs/functions/), and
   [Migrations and adapters](/ketjs/migrations/) in that order.
3. **Serve and integrate.** Use [HTTP routes and responses](/ketjs/http/),
   [HTTP contracts and OpenAPI](/ketjs/openapi/), [Sessions and tenants](/ketjs/sessions-tenants/),
   [Durable jobs and workers](/ketjs/jobs/), and [Storage, transport, and streams](/ketjs/integrations/).
4. **Build presentation.** Begin with [Form validation](/ketjs/form-validation/) and
   [Rendering and islands](/ketjs/rendering/), then add [Themes and KTL](/ketjs/themes/),
   [Menus and localization](/ketjs/menus-i18n/), or [Reports and PDF](/ketjs/reports/).
5. **Verify and deliver.** Finish with [Testing](/ketjs/testing/),
   [CLI and configuration](/ketjs/cli-config/), and [Deployment](/ketjs/deployment/).
   [Public API](/ketjs/api/) and [Publishing packages](/ketjs/releasing/) are references for library
   and release work rather than prerequisites for an application.

:::tip[Changing KetSuite instead?]
KetSuite applies these contracts but adds its own module ownership and security rules. Start with the
[KetSuite developer guide](/ketsuite/) instead of reading the complete framework guide first.

## Current runtime requirements

- Node.js 24 or later.
- ESM (`"type": "module"`).
- TypeScript for authored applications; production executes emitted JavaScript only.
- SQLite by default, or PostgreSQL through `@ketvietlab/ketjs-postgres` and the optional `postgres` driver.

KetJS does not execute TypeScript in production. The development scaffold uses `tsx` only as an
in-memory compiler and watcher.
