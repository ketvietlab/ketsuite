# Agent rules

- Everything written into the repository or onto GitHub is in English: branch names, commit messages, pull request titles and descriptions, review comments, and issue comments. Vietnamese remains correct for product strings, user-facing copy, and the handoff documents written for a specific team; conversation with a maintainer follows whatever language they are using.
- Branch names must start with `feat/` or `fix/`. Do not use agent-specific prefixes such as `claude/` or `codex/`.
- Develop and test in the same scope: while implementing a change, run the targeted tests for the package, module, screen, or flow being changed.
- Feature pull requests carry no CI apart from `permission coverage` (into `develop`). Before pushing, run the tests for the part you changed — including its live-Postgres tests when it has them — plus the quality contracts in `verify.yml` (format, lint, terminology, build, zero-dep, UI, staff-channel, Channel API, doc snippets, types), and list the commands and results in the pull request description. Re-run them after review changes or a rebase.
- Do not run the full test suite as part of routine local development. The full suite runs in CI on the promotion pull request from `integration` into `develop` and on the release pull request into `master`.
- Every style change must be verified in a real browser at desktop and mobile widths for every affected locale and screen state. Check horizontal gaps between adjacent controls, vertical spacing at header/tab/body boundaries, identical body padding across sibling tabs, overflow, and that hidden or empty elements occupy zero layout space. Record or update visual evidence before considering the style work complete.
- Every behavior, public contract, configuration, workflow, or architecture change must update the corresponding documentation in the same change. Use the documentation index below to find the owning page; update every affected page when a change crosses boundaries.
- All new or updated documentation pages belong under `docs/src/content/docs/`; never add documentation Markdown at the root of `docs/`. `docs/README.md` is reserved for maintaining the docs application, and existing root-level Markdown is legacy material to migrate into the content collection rather than extend.
- Every fenced code block in the documentation must begin with a language-valid location comment. Use `// File: path` for TypeScript, JavaScript, TSX, and JSONC; `# Run from: path` for shell commands; `%% File: path` for Mermaid; `{% comment %} File: path {% endcomment %}` for Liquid/KTL; `<!-- File: path -->` for Markdown and HTML; and `# File: path` for text, HTTP, and other plain examples. Use a concrete repository or example-project path, not a vague label. Run `npm --prefix docs run check:snippets` before handoff.

## Mandatory KetSuite handler and screen organization

- Read `docs/src/content/docs/ketsuite/module-development.md` before changing a KetSuite function, and `docs/src/content/docs/ketsuite/backend-development.md` before changing a routed screen or its route.
- Public module source lives directly in `packages/ketsuite/src/modules/<module>/`. Private deployments may use `apps/ketsuite/modules/<module>/src/`. Paths such as `functions/` and `screens/` are relative to that source root; preserve each repository's build layout and entry points.
- Any edit to an existing module `functions.ts` must refactor that entire file in the same change: split named handlers and descriptors by capability into `functions/*.ts`, assemble at `functions/index.ts`, and detect duplicate keys before merging groups. Remove forwarding-only `operations.ts` layers; move genuine shared logic into specifically named policies, queries, or domain services. Do not leave the remaining monolithic registry for another agent or create a new `functions.ts` registry.
- Preserve function keys, every descriptor field, permission coverage, transactions, and public exports. Update imports and source-based audits for moved files without weakening their assertions.
- Do not call another handler directly for internal code reuse. The narrow exception is an explicitly documented, publicly exported function spec for composition within one transaction, such as `pricingFunctionSpecs.priceFor` or `accountFunctionSpecs.quoteLine`. Consumers must preserve its input/output contract, declare all effects, and use the caller's authorized context and scope. User-facing routes still use `ctx.call()`. Replacing this extension contract requires a compatible public service and a released version before private consumers migrate.
- When editing a routed business screen or its route, move the complete affected screen into its own `screens/*.tsx` file and write its composition in JSX. This applies regardless of the current name, including `screen.ts`, `screen.tsx`, `screens.ts`, `screens.tsx`, `routes.ts`, and `routes.tsx`. Route files contain only declarations/adapters, never JSX, view builders, or screen-specific rendering logic; `screens/index.ts` only exports.
- Shared response/frame helpers such as `modules/backend/screen.ts` are infrastructure, not legacy business screens. Keep using them for locale, session/frame context, and document/fragment responses. API/webhook handlers and public website theme pipelines are not routed business screens; do not add an admin shell to a portal or kiosk while organizing its JSX components.

## Design system contract

- `packages/design-system` and the public `@ketvietlab/design-system` package are the single source of truth for KetSuite UI tokens, typography, primitives, layouts, patterns, and `data-ui` contracts. Use `npm run design:system` to inspect the canonical catalogue.
- Every new or modified KetSuite UI must consume the design system before introducing local components or CSS. Inter is the canonical UI typeface; colour, spacing, density, radius, shadow, and motion must come from design-system tokens.
- KetSuite modules own business data, translated labels, routes, and domain behaviour. Reusable presentation belongs in `packages/design-system`, which must remain domain-neutral and depend only on `@ketvietlab/ketjs-view`.
- Do not create or retain parallel token scales, generic primitives, or copied component styles. When a reusable capability is missing, add it to the design system first, expose its states in the catalogue, and then migrate the consuming UI.
- Group content with unframed `Section`, `Stack` and `Grid`. `DataTable`, `Metric` and `ContentCard` already own their surfaces; do not nest them inside `Surface` or another card. Record context belongs in one aside, not duplicated in the shell rail.
- Section headings have no bottom border or divider padding in any page pattern. Separate sections with layout gaps, not implicit section borders or page-specific heading overrides. Dividers must be explicit where content requires them.
- For titled form/table blocks, keep the title inside their owning surface: `Surface title` + `RecordForm`, or `DataTable title`. These headings use `--kv-text-xl` (18px). A titled table owns a single panel with 12px inset (the sales demo card) and an unframed inner viewport; consumers must not add another `Surface` around it. Plain tables and unframed section headings remain available.
- The connected sales demo uses `data-presentation="grouped"`: grey canvas, grey page chrome and white working groups, with a grey KetSuite sidebar in light mode. Keep one visible boundary per independent working group. The record aside is one continuous white region with unframed subsections; Kanban retains separate record cards. Do not apply this opt-in presentation globally or wrap whole pages in cards.
- Tables navigate through the row, with one keyboard link per record. Do not add row action buttons. Keep selection separate from navigation and place bulk commands in collection controls outside the table.
- Collection controls belong in `ListChrome` above the body, including result context and `pager`. Do not put a separate pagination panel below the table in `ListPage.footer`; prefer the visible record range with previous/next navigation.
- Forms are always inline: label on the left, control on the right, with help/errors under the control. Preserve this arrangement on mobile and in narrow panels; only the number of field pairs per row may collapse. Check the containing panel width, not only the viewport. Canvas workspaces preserve spatial columns with local horizontal scrolling on small screens.
- Every design-system component or visual-state change requires contract/unit coverage plus browser E2E at desktop and mobile widths. Read the generated visual evidence before handoff and never commit that evidence.
- When touching legacy KetSuite UI, bring the affected surface onto the design-system contract within the same change; unrelated screens do not require a big-bang migration.

### Mandatory KetSuite page design

- Every routed KetSuite administration screen must use exactly one canonical full-page pattern: `ListPage` for collections and result sets, `RecordPage` for create/edit/detail/workflow around one durable subject, or `WorkspacePage` for dashboards and operational surfaces. Use `layout="canvas"` only for horizontally spatial work such as boards, maps, timelines, floor plans, and KDS. Do not introduce another full-page pattern.
- `FormPage`, `DashboardPage`, and `BoardPage` are compatibility adapters only. Do not add new consumers. `Framed` is deprecated and must not appear in production screen code.
- Application screens must use the KetSuite page boundary so navigation and organisation context come from `Frame`. The shell location band owns company context; operational pages do not render breadcrumbs or a page context band. Every operational page renders one identity header. Disable the shell topbar when the page owns that identity; never render duplicate page titles or rebuild breadcrumbs inside a module.
- Canonical page titles are 24px on desktop and 16px at the compact breakpoint, with tight `1.2` line height. Descriptions use normal `1.45` line height. Title-to-description spacing is the heading's 4px gap; do not add per-pattern title, subtitle, eyebrow, or subline margins.
- Canonical page headers use `var(--kv-space-4) var(--kv-page-padding-x)` on desktop and `var(--kv-space-4) var(--kv-space-4) var(--kv-space-3)` at the compact breakpoint. The application `[data-ui="content"]` must not add padding around these patterns. A dense operational list body begins with `var(--kv-space-2)` top padding.
- These measurements belong to `packages/design-system`; modules must not override them locally. Any intentional change must update all canonical patterns, their compatibility adapters, contract tests, catalogue specimens, desktop/mobile browser coverage, and affected locales in the same change.
